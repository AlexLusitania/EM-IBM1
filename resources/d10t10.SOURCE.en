You know one of the intense pleasures of travel in one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways to still feel their past and the wind touch and stones pause by rain I tasted in the bitter leaves of plants
Just to know that job were Sharman still journey beyond the Milky Way or the the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning or that in the Himalayas the Buddha still pursue the breadth of the Dharma it's really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense but is just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that are lineage made albeit successfully many generations ago
And of course we all share the same adaptive imperative
We're all born we all bring their children to the world
We go through initiation rites
We have to deal with the next next will separation of death so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing we all dance we all have art
But what's interesting is unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture
And whether it is the The per man in the force of Borneo or the voodoo acolytes in Haiti or the moon warriors in the Kice you desert of northern Kenya accord on their own the mountains of the Andes or a carrot kind of Ansari in the middle of the Sahara this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago or indeed a your accurate or on the slopes of Chama long Emma Everest the goddess mother of the world
All of these people's teachers there are other ways of being other ways of thinking other ways of orienting yourself from the earth
And this is an idea you think about it can only fill you with hope
Now together the myriad cultures of the world makeup are a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelopes the planet and is as important to the well being of the planet is indeed is the biological one of life that you know the biosphere
And you might think of this cultural web of life has been an Ethnos fear and you might define the Ethnos fear is being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams nests ideas inspirations intuition is brought into being by the human human imagination since the dawn of consciousness
You have to know sphere is humanity's great legacy
It's a symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishing and inquisitive species
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded so too is the Ethnos fear and if anything at a far greater rate
No biologists for example would dare suggest that fifty percent of all species are more Bender on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approach is what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity
And the great indicator that of course is language loss
when each of you in this room were born there are six thousand languages spoken on the planet
Now a language is not just a body of a vocabulary or set of grammatical rules
A languages the flash of the human spirit
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes in a material world
Every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities
another six thousand languages as we sit here today in Monterey fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children
There are no longer being taught to babies which means effectively unless something changes are already dead
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence to be the last of your people to speak your language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors are Intesa paid the promise of the children
And yet that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue
And I know that some of you say well when to be better when the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language and I say Great let's make that language your bar let's make a Cantonese
Let's make it coldly
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language
And so what I'd like to do with you today is an sort of take you on a journey through the Ethnos fear a brief journey through the Ethnos fear to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost
Now there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say different ways of being I really do mean different ways of being
Take for example this child of about US Santa Northwest arms on the people of the Anaconda who believe that mythological they came up the Milk River from the eastern the belly of sacred snakes
Now this is a people who cognitive Lee do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is acquitted of the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called linguistic exile gummy you must marry someone who speaks a different language
And this is all rooted in the theological passed yet the curious thing is in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practicing a language
They simply listen and then began to speak
or one of most fascinating tribes ever lived with the UAW Ronnie of North Eastern Ecuador and stylish in people first contacted peacefully nineteen fifty
The nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact made a critical mistake
dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves and what we would say to be friendly gestures for getting at these people the rainforests had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor tried to look behind the face to apply the former the figure found nothing and concluded these are calling cards and the devil and so the spear the five missionaries to death
But the one I didn't just spear outsiders
They spirit each other
Fifty four percent of the mortality was due to them sparing each other
We trace genealogy is back in generations we found two instances of natural death and repressed for the people of that about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gone so old that he died getting old so we spear him anyway
But at the same time they had a personal cases knowledge of the forest that was astonishing
They're hunters could smell animal urine at forty paces and tell you what species left it behind
In the early eighties I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard but was interested in going down to Haiti infiltrating the sixth societies which were the foundation of devalue strengthen the top mark could and securing the poison used to make zombies
In order to make sense sort of sensation of course I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of wood dune and food is not a black magic cold
the contrary it's a complex metaphysical worldview
ten 
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world but you say
Christianity Islam Buddhism Judaism whatever
There's always one continent left out is the assumption being that sub Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs will of course they did and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora the slavery era
But what makes voodoo so interesting is that assists living relationship between living in the dead
The Living give birth to the spirits
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displaces soul of the living so that for that brief shining moment the act like becomes the god
That's where the Buddhists like to say that you white people go to church and speak about God
We Dance the temple and become God
And because you are possessed you are taken by the spirit how can you be harm
Sue see these astonishing demonstrations food or acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity a rather astonishing example of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when cattle lies in the state of extreme excitation
Now of all the peoples that I've ever been with the most extraordinary or the Kobe of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia
descendants of the ancient Tyrone civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Columbia and the wake of the conquest these people retreat into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain
In a bloodstained continent these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish
To this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but they're training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four sequestered in the shadowy world of darkness and stone huts the base of glaciers for eighteen years to nine year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spent in their natural mothers womb now they're metaphorically in the womb of the great mother
And for this entire time they are in culture it into the values of their society values and maintain the proposition that their prayers and their per is alone maintain the cosmic or we might say the ecological balance
And at the end of this amazing initiation one day there suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and that Chris sold moment of awareness the first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed and stunning glory and a pre steps back and said You see it it's really as I've told you
it is that beautiful it is yours to protect
They call themselves the elder brothers and they say we were the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world
Now this level of intuition becomes very important
Never we think of indigenous people and landscape we either invoke Rousseau in the old canard the no right nor the noble savage which is an idea racist in its simplicity or alternatively we invite invoke for row in cities people were closer to the earth and we are
Well indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia
There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asthmatic or in the chilling winds of Tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forger traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on her idea of being self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathing the being by human consciousness
Now what does that mean
It means that a young kid from the Andes whose raised to believe that that mountains and Apple spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource where that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that amount was a pile of rock ready to be mined
Whether it's an abode of a spirit or pile of ore is irrelevant
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines a relationship between the individual and the natural world
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those force existed to be cut
That made me a different human being and my friends amongst the quantum yields who believe that those force for the abode of Coca Cola crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwell the north end of the world spirits they would have to engage during their home it's a initiation
Now if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities you can begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries take this plant here
The photograph I took in the northwest Amazon just last April 
This is I LASKAS which many of you have heard about the most powerful cycle activists arose preparation of the shamans repertoire
What makes ILA's CA fascinating is not this year pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it's made really of two different sources on the one hand this woody Leon I which has entered a series of beta carbones harming harmony and mildly hallucinogenic to take the lot vine alone is rather to have so blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psycho to have veered us
This plant has in it some very powerful trip to means very close to brain serotonin diner for trip to mean five-month Oxford I'm of a trip to mean
If you've ever seen the Yano mommy blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species is also contains five and Fox are dying of a trip to me
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being them shot out of a rifle barrel lined broke paintings of landing on a sea of electricity
It doesn't it doesn't it doesn't create the doesn't create a distortion of reality creates the illusion of reality
factor used argue with my Professor Richard M shalt is through the man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the nineteen thirties I used to argue that you couldn't classify these trip to means of hallucinogenic because it by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination
But the thing about trip to means is they cannot be taken orally because they're D nature by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called mono I mean oxidation
They can only be taken orally is taken in conjunction with some other chemical that D nature Zia Mayo
Now the fascinating things of the beta carbones found within that Leon R R Emil inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentially eight the trip to mean so you Astros of a question
How in flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants that these people find these two morphological unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version the whole been great in some of the parts
Well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless
But you ask the Indians and they say the plans talk to us
What does that mean
This tried the co fun has seventeen varieties of ILA's ska all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referee Bill to our eye as one species
And then you ask them how they establish your tax on a me and they say Didn't I thought you knew something about plants
I mean you know anything and I said no
Well it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties in the light of a full moon and it sings to you in a different key
Now that's not going to get your Ph D at Harvard but it's a lot more interestingly counting stay means
Now the problem of carbon effect even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as Queen colorful but some are reduced the margins of history is a real world meaning Our World News on
All the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now is not can be remembered for its forgers technological innovations rather is year in which we stood by neither actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem isn't change
all cultures through all time have constant being engaged in a in a dance with new possibilities of life
And the problem is not technology itself
the Sioux Indians did not stop in soon they gave up the bow and arrow anymore than American stop in American we give up the horse and buggy
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the Ethnos fear it is power the crude face of domination
Every you look around the world you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away these are dynamic living people's being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to whether it's egregious deforestation in the homeland of the planned a nomadic people from Southeast Asia from Sarawak a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers where you can see the river itself a soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo way to the So China Sea where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest or in the case of the UN-AU mommy is a disease entities that have come in the wake of the discovery of gold
Or if we go into the mounds of Tibet from doing a lot of research recently you'll see it's accrued face of political domination
No genocide the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned but ethnicity I'd the destruction of people's way of life is not only not condemned its universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it the ground level
I once traveled six thousand miles from Chengdu in western China over land through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa where the young colleague and it was only when I got to LA SA that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes one point two million people killed by the card reader in the Cultural Revolution
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion
his uncle fled with His Holiness in the diaspora took the people to Nepal
His mother was incarcerated for the price of for the crime of being wealthy
He was smuggled into the jail at the time at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him
The sister of done that brave deed was putting of education camp
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband that of Mao and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor
the pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold
And in the end than it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace of Pollock for medical world of diversity
Margaret Mead the great anthropologist said before she died that her greatest fear that was was that as we drifted toward this blandly amorphous generic worldview not only would we see the entire range of human imagination reduced to a more narrow and more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten that there are even other possibilities
And it's humbling to remember that our species is perhaps been around for six hundred thousand years
the Neolithic Revolution which gave us agriculture which time we succumb to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman is displaced by the prose of the priesthood we created hierarchy specialization surplus is only ten thousand years ago
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely three hundred years old
Now that shall history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia
When these myriad cultures the world are asked the meaning of being human they respond with ten thousand different voices
And it's within that song that we're all readers the governor the possibility of being what we are a fully conscious species fully aware of insuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish and there are great moments of optimism
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of BaFin island when I went in our real hunting sinew at people and this man or like told me a marvelous story of his grandfather
The Canadian government has not always been kind of the Inuit people injuring the nineteen fifties to establish her sovereignty we force them in the settlements
This Old Man s grandfather refused to go
The family fearful for his life took away all of his weapons all of these tools
Now you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold they took advantage of it
the runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide
So this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night of the blizzard it was blowing
he simply slipped outside pulled down a seal skin trousers and de for catered into his hand and as a faeces began to freeze U shaped in the form of a blade
You put a spray of saliva on the edge of the ship knife and set finally froze solid he butchered dog with it
He skin the dog and improvise to harness took the rib cage the dog improvise a sled harnessed up in adjacent dog and disappeared over the ice floes ship knife and belt
Talk about getting by with nothing
And this in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world
The Canadian government in April nineteen ninety nine gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together
It's our new homeland is called noon of it
It's an independent territory they control all mineral resources
An amazing example of how a nation state can read reached seek restitution with its people
And finally in the end I think it's pretty obvious at least all of us who have travelled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that they're not remote at all
their homelands of somebody
They represent branches of the human imagination they go back to the dawn of time and for all of us the dreams of these children like the dreams of our own children become part of the naked geography of hope
So what we're trying to do with the National Geographic finally is we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything
We think the polemics everything that polemics are not persuasive but we think that storytelling can change the world and so we're probably the best storytelling institution in the world get thirty five million hits in a website every month
hundred fifty six nations carrier television channel
Our magazines are read by millions
A and what we're doing is a series of journeys to the Ethnos sphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen and hopefully therefore embrace gradually one by one the central revelation of anthropology that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way that we can find a way to live in a truly multi cultural pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well being
Thank you very much
What I'm going to show you first as quickly as I can is is something some foundation workers and some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition of almost exactly a year ago this is sea dragon and its environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data
We're looking at many many gigabytes of of digital photos here and comes soon seamlessly and continuously zooming and panning through the thing we ranging anywhere we want
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at how big these collections are or how big the images are
The most of them are ordinary additional camera photos but this one for example as a scan from the Library of Congress and it's in the inner three hundred megapixel range
It doesn't doesn't make any difference because the only thing that that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment it's also very flexible architecture
This is an entire books this is an example of non non image data
This is bleak house by Dickens every every column is is a chapter
And to prove to you that it's that's really text and not an image we can do something like cell to really show that this is a real representation of the tax is not picture
Maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read an e book
I wouldn't recommend it
This is a more realistic case this is an issue of the Guardian
Every large images the beginning of a section
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or newspaper which is inherently multi scale have medium
We've also done a little something with the corner of a of this particular issue of the garden
We've made up of fake ad that's very high resolution of much higher than to be able to get in an ordinary at and we can bedded extra Comte
What is the features of this car you can see it here
or other models the or even technical specifications
And this this really this really gets in some of these ideas about really doing away with with those limits on on screen real estate
We hope that this seems so no more no more pop-ups other kind of rubbish like that should be necessary
And of course mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this
And this one I really want spend any time on except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well
But those are all the roads and in the US
superimposed on top of other NASA and here's facial image
So let's pull up a now something else
This is actually live from the life on the Web now you can go check it out
The project called for sense which really Mary's two different technologies
One of them is sea dragon and the other is person very beautiful computer vision research done by No it's namely gravest in the earthly Washington call advised by Steve sites that you don
And that's a list give Microsoft Research a very nice collaboration
And so this is this is live on the Web it's powered by sea dragon
You can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views where we can we can we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience
But but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that corresponds to the real space in which these these shots all taken near grassy likes nickname Rockies all these shots were taken so you see elements here of a of stabilize slide show or panoramic panoramic imaging and these things of organ related related spatial ing
I'm not sure if I have if I have time to show you any other environment
There are some that are much more spatial
But I'd like to jump straight to to one of no was original data sets an assessment early prototype of photos and thought we first got working in the summer to show you what I think is really that the punchline behind this this technology the photos and technology and it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that put up on the website
We and we had to worry about the lawyers and so on
This is a reconstruction of Magellan cathedral that was done entirely computational E from images script from flicker just like looking down into flicker and you've got some pictures of guys in T shirts and of the campus and so on and each of these orange cones represents an image that was there was discovered to belong to this model
And so these are all these are all Flickr images and they've all been related especially in this way
It just navigate and it's very simple way
You Thank you 
is very is very gratifying simply the other side of this kind of reception here
So so this is as it considers a very this is this is lots of different types of cameras it's everything from cellphone cameras to professional Lessel ours a quite a large number of invited to get into this environment
if I can find some of the sort of weird ones
So many of them are included by faces and so on 
somewhere in here there's actually a their series of photographs here we go
This is actually a poster of larger than that registered correctly
So if we yeah we can we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this of this environment
What what the point he really is is that we can do things with the social environment this is this is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory of visually what the earth looks like and link all that together
All those photos become linked together and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts
You have a model that emerges again tire Earth
figure this is as the long tail to Stephen Lawler ZTE Virtual Earth work
And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater to the users as they as the user
their own photos are getting tagged with medical data that somebody else center
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are then than my photo of not from cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all that data and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space is that met averse using everybody else's photos and do a kind of across model and and and cross user and social experience that way
And of course the byproduct of all that is immensely rich virtual models of of every interesting part of the earth a collected not just from from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on but from the collective memory
Thank you so much
I understand is to understand this right that what your software is going to allow is that at some point really within the next few years all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world and basically link together
Yes what this is really going to discovery
It's creating hyper links if you will between between images
And it's doing that based on the content inside the images
Like it's really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information the lot of those images have
When you do a Web search for images that you type in phrases in the text on the web page is is carrying a lot of information about the picture itself
Now what if that picture links all of your pictures
And the amount of semantic interconnection any amount of riches that comes out of that is really huge is the classic network 
laser as truly incredible cannot change
Thank you
I talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard and I'll try to make some connections myself in case you missed them
I want to start with what I call the official dogma
if you'll dogma of what
the official dogma of all Western industrial societies
And the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom
The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human
And because if people have freedom than each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice
The more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
This I think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it
And it's also deeply embedded in our lives
I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us
This is my supermarket that such a big one
I want to say Oh just the word about salad dressing
A hundred seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegar AES you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer to chew
So this is what the supermarket is like
And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers CD player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems
We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of components that are on offer in one store
You gotta admit that's a lot of choice
And other domains the world of communications
There was a time when I was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from Ma Bell
You rented your phone you didn't buy it
One consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke
And those days are gone
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones
These are cell phones of the future
My favorite is the middle one the M P three player nose hair trimmer and crammed relay torch
And if if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
And you know the answer to this question now is
The answer is no
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much
So in other aspects of life in a much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true
health care it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do
instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what we can do a or we can do B
A has these benefits and these risks
Be has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do
And you say Doc what should I do
And the doc says a has these benefits and risks and be has these benefits are risks
What do you want to do 
And you say if you were me Doc what would you do
And the doc says but I'm not you
And the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and that's not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient
there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be change
something as dramatic as alloy our identity is now become a matter of choice as the slide is meant to indicate
We get to we don't inherit an identity we get to inventor
we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like
And that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be in
with respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you've got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could
The only real choice was who not when and not what you did after
Nowadays everything is very much up for grabs
I teach wonderfully intelligent students and I assign twenty percent less work than I used to
And it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent
It's because they are preoccupied asking themselves should I get married or not should I get married now
Should I get married later should I have kids first or career first
All of these are consuming questions
And they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses
And indeed they should these are important questions to answer
work we are blessed as Carl's pointing out with the technology that enables Xu's to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the Randolph Hotel
There is one corner by the way that I'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually were the were the height wife I works
I'm not talking about a because I want to use it
So what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or shouldn't be working
We can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cellphone on one hip and our BlackBerry on our other hip and arse laptop presumably on our laps
And even if they're all shut off every minute that we're watching our kid mutilated soccer game we are also asking ourselves should I answer this cell phone call
Should I respond to this email should I Draft this letter
And even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kids soccer game very different than it would have been
So everywhere we look at a big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice
And the world we used to live in looked like this
That is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice
The world we now live in looks like this
And the question is is this good news or bad news
And the answer is yes
We all know what's good about it so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it
All this choice has to affects two negative effects on people
One affect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation
With so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans
a colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard these gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees in about two thousand different workplaces
And what she found is that for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
You offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five Why
Because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which front to choose that you just put it off until tomorrow
And then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices
And I think it makes the world look like this
you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right
You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dress
So that's one affect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice then we would be if we have fewer options to choose from
And there are several reasons for this
One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better and what happens is this I imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtract from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
Second what economists call opportunity costs
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much of the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
Well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject but that that make it you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen
Here's an example for those of you or New Yorkers I apologize
But here's what you're supposed to be thinking
Here's this couple on the Hamptons
Very expensive real estate
gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves
What could be better well damn it this guy is thinking its Aug
Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away
I could be parking right in front of my bills
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great Parkinson's
opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific
And the more options there are to consider the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected biases opportunity cost
Here's another example
Now now there's this cartoon makes a lot of point
It makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly
But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're choosing not to do other things
And those other things may have lots of attractive features and is going to make what you're doing less attractive
Third escalation of expectations
This hit me when I went to replace my jeans
I wear jeans almost all the time
And there was a time when genes came in one flavor and you bottom and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and wash them enough times they started to fit feel OK
So I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing his old ones and I said I you know going Pair jeans here's my side
Under shopkeeper said You want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit
You want button flier zipper fly you one stone washed or acid wash
You want to distressed
You and boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah ONONAIYE went
my jaw dropped and after I recovered I said I want the kind that used to be the only kind
He had no idea what that was so I spent an hour trying on all these damn genes and I walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans I had ever hand
I did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
But I felt worse
Why were a whole book to try to explain this to myself
The reason I felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair gene GE should be went up
I had very low expect had no particular expectations when the only came in one flavor
when they came a hundred flavors damn it one of them should have been perfect
And when I got was good but it wasn't perfect
And so I compared what I got to what I expected and when I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected
adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be
And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with with results even when they're good results
Nobody in the world of marketing knows this because if they did you would not know what this was about
The truth is more like this
The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
Nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that such stuff is as good as you expected to be
You will never be pleasantly surprised because you're expectations my expectations have gone through the roof
The secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret of happiness is low expectations
I want to say just a little autobiographical moment that I actually married to a wife in and she's really quite wonderful
I couldn't have done better I didn't settle
But settling isn't always such a bad thing
finally one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible
It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
You could have done better
with a thousand with a hundred different kinds of genes on display there is no excuse for failure
And so when people make decisions and even they're though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed about them they blame themselves
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation
I believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
And so the net result is that we do better at all in general objectively and we feel worse
So let me remind you
This is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true and it's all false it is not true
There's no question that some choice is better than none but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice
There are some magical amount I don't know what it is
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare
Now as a policy matter I'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence
There are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them were the their problem is not that they have too much choice
Their problem is that they have too little
So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern affluent Western societies
And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this Steve lever talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install car a infants care Chelsea's dulled help it's a waste of money
What I'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help
They actually hurt
They actually make us worse off
If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options not only with those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also
This is what economists call a parade Oh improving move
income redistribution will make everyone better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice places
So to conclude you're supposed to read this cartoon and being sophisticated person say and what is this fish no
You know nothing is possible in this fish bowl
impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way I read it at first
The more I thought about it however the more I came to the view that this fish know something
Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fish bowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
If you share this fish bowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
You increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction
everybody needs a fish bowl
This one is almost certainly too limited perhaps even for the fish certainly for us
But the absence of some metaphorical fish ball is a recipe for misery and I suspect disaster
Thank you very much
Procter about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes
We're actually starting at a new point we've been digitize in biology and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesized in life
So we've always been trying to ask big questions
What is life is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand the at various levels
We've tried various approaches pairing it down to a minimal components
We've been digitize in it now for almost twenty years when we sequence the human genome was going from the analog world the biology into the digital world of the computer
Now we're trying to ask Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism Micah plasma Jenna tail Ian that has the smallest genome for a it species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with the even smaller genome
We're able to knock out on the order of a hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that their here
But when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple compared to ours trust me this is simple but but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time is very unlikely that this would yield a living cell
So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesized this chromosome so we could very that components to ask some of these most fundamental questions
And so we started down the road of Can we synthesized chromosome
I can't chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before
And if we do can we boot up a chromosome
chromosome by the way is just a piece of inert chemical material
So our pace of digitize in life has been increasing at an exponential pace
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing and our latest point would put it on now on exponential curve
We started this over fifteen years ago
It took several stages in fact starting with a bio ethical review before we did the first experiments
But it turns out synthesized in DNA is very difficult
There's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA a thirty to fifty letters in length and it's a degenerate process so the longer you make the piece the more errors there are
So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors
This was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of Phi X one seventy four
It's a small virus that kills bacteria
We designed the pieces went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about five thousand letters
the exciting phase can we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in a bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles
The viral particles and were released from the cells and came back and killed the E coli
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model
That they left more than you guys are
And and so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system
But we wanted to go much larger we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome so over five hundred eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we build them it could sets the size of the viruses so we could actually very the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are
design is critical and if you're starting with digital information in the computer that digital information has to be really accurate
When we first sequence this genome and nineteen ninety five the standard of accuracy was one error per ten thousand base pairs
We actually found on re sequencing at thirty errors had we use that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up
Part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller sub-units we have to design so they can go together
We design unique elements into this
You may have read that we put water marks in
Think of this we have a four letter genetic code a C G and T
triplets of that letter of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there is a single letter designation for each of the amino acids
So we can use the genetic code to write out words sentences thoughts
A initially all we did was autograph it
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry 
We design these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes a there's enzymes that repair them and put them together
And we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seven tunnel that's seven thousand letters but those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand
at each stage we grew up these pieces and abundant so we get sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute
We were trying to get to the point of automation
So this looks like a basketball playoff
When we get into these really large pieces over a hundred thousand base pairs they won't any longer grow readily in E coli it exhaust all the modern tools of molecular biology in so we turned to other mechanisms
We knew there is a mechanism called home Allah just re combination fact biology uses to repair DNA A that can put pieces together
Here's an example of that there's an organism called Diana Kaka's radio door Agnes that can take three million Radsady radiation
You can see in the top panel its chromosomes just gets blown apart
twelve to twenty four hours later put it back together exactly as it was before
We have thousands of organisms that can do this
these organisms can be totally dusted Qaeda they can live in a vacuum
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new aqueous environment
In fact NASA has shown a lot of this is out there
Here's an actual micro graph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in yeast put some together automatically 
This is not an electron micro graph this is just a regular photo micro graph
It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope
These are pictures over about a a six second period
So this is the publication we had just a short while ago
This is over five hundred eighty thousand letters of genetic code it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure
So over three hundred million molecular weight
If we pant printed out of the ten font with no spacing it takes a hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code
Well how do we boot up a chromosome how how do we activate this
Obviously with the virus it's pretty simple it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria
It's also simpler when you go into you carry us like ourselves you can just pop out the nucleus and pop and another one and that's what you've all heard about with cloning
with bacteria NARC here the chromosome is integrated into the cell but we recently showed that we can do a complete a transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activated
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species roughly these two were as distant as human and my eyes we had a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome wheeled digested with enzymes to kill all the proteins and was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell when the you'll appreciate our are very sophisticated graphics here
The new chromosome went into the cell
In fact we thought this might be as far as it went but we tried to design the process a little bit further
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or third one from somewhere adding thousands of new traits in the second to that species
So people who think of evolution is just one gene change in a time have missed much of biology
There's enzymes called restriction enzymes actually digest DNA
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one the cell the chromosome we put in does
It expressing it recognize the other chromosome as foreign material chewed it up and so we ended up just with the cell with the new chromosome
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it
And with a very short period of time all the characteristics of one species were lost and converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell
all the proteins change the membranes changed when we read the genetic code is exactly what we had transferred then
So this may sound like genomic alchemy but we can by moving the software DNA around a change things quite dramatically
Now I have argued this is not Genesis desists building on three and a half billion years of evolution
And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the came bring an explosion where there's massive new species nation based on this digital design 
Why do this
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs
We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next forty years
To put it in context for myself I was born in nineteen forty six
there's now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in nineteen forty sex within forty years though before
We have trouble feeding providing fresh clean water medicines fuel for the six and a half billion
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine
We use over five billion tons of coal thirty billion plus barrels of oil that's a hundred million barrels a day
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that it's going to be a huge challenge
Then of course there's all that I C from this material that ends up in the atmosphere
We now from our discovery around the world have a database with about twenty million genes and I like to think of these as the design components of the future
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components and look at the diversity that came out of that
We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination
We now have techniques because of these rapid methods of synthesis to do what we're calling common editorial genomics
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day
When you think of processing these twenty million different genes are trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals new vaccines which can change just with a small team do more molecular biology than the last twenty years of all science
And it's just standard selection we can select for viability chemical or fuel production vaccine production X
This is a at a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer
You know we don't know necessarily what with the look like we know exactly what their genetic code looks like 
We're focusing on now a fourth generation fuels
You've seen recently corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment
We have second and third generation fuels are becoming out relatively soon that are sugar to the much higher value fuels like octane are two different types of Butte and all
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and luminous availability is if we start with CEO to wear as its feedstock and sure we're working with designing cells to go down this road
And we think will have the first fourth generation fuels and about eighteen months
sunlight in C is one method
But in our discovery around the world we have all kinds of other methods
This is an organism we see the described and nineteen ninety six
It lives in the deep ocean about a mile and a half deep almost at boiling water temperatures
It takes CEO to to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source
We're looking to see if we can take captured CEO to which can easily be piped to sites convert that CEO to back in the fuel to drive this process
So in a short period of time we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of what is life
work truly
But also were now working on using the same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines
You've seen this year with flu were always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to write vaccine
I think that can be changed by building common of real vaccines in advance
Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing now the evolutionary tree are speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria are HKIA and eventually you carry arts
we're a ways away from improving people our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that Thank you very much
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LA TSE
And I promise to come back and give you an update on how that machine works
So this is it and for those of you who weren't there the Elysee is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted twenty seven kilometers in circumference
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second
So nothing if not ambitious
This is the machine below Geneva
We take the pictures of those many big bangs in size detectors
This is the one I work on it's called the Atlas detector forty four meters wide twenty three meets in diameter
spectacular picture here of Atlas under construction so you can see the scale
On the tenth of September last year we turn the machine on for the first time
And this picture was taken by Atlas
It caused immense celebration of the control room
It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the L H C colliding with a piece of the Elysee deliberately and showering particles into the detector
In other words when we saw that picture on September tenth we knew the machine works which is a great triumph
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer or this one's mine went on to Google and saw the front page was like that
It means we make cultural impact as well as scientific impact
About a week later we had a problem with the machine related actually to these bits of wire here he's gold wires
Those wires carry thirteen thousand amps when the machines working at full power
Now the engineers among she will look at them and say no they don't have a small wires
They can do that because when they're very cold they what's called super conducting wire
So at minus two hundred and seventy one degrees colder than the space between the stars those wires can take that current
In one of the joins between over nine thousand magnets in LA to see there was a manufacturing defect
So the Y heated up slightly and its thirteen thousand and suddenly encountered electrical resistance
This was the result
Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets way over twenty tons and they moved about a foot
So we damaged about fifty of the magnets
We had to take them out which we did
We've reconditioned Amal fix them
They're all on their way back underground now
By the end of March the Elysee will be intact again
We will switch it on him we expect to take data in June or July and continue without quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are
Now of course in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge and it's easy to refuse
I think the fact that it's so difficult the fact that we're overreaching is the value of things like the Elysee
I leave the final word to a an English scientist Humphrey Davy who I suspect when defending his processor Che's useless experiments is prostitute was Michael Faraday home said said this nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate that there are no mysteries in nature that triumphs a complete and that there are no new worlds to conquer
Thank you
I am a writer
writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change
But that said Um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of re calibrate my whole relationship with this work
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this memoir called Eat Pray Love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books when out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international bestseller thing
the result of which is that everywhere I go now people treat me like I'm doomed
Seriously doomed doomed
like they come out to me now at all worried and they say Aren't you afraid to come in to Friedgen never going to be able to top that
Um Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again
So that's reassuring you know 
But it would be worse except for that I happen to remember that over twenty years ago when I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with the same kind of sort of fear based reaction
And people would say Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success
I m afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you
Aren't you afraid that you can work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come that you're going to Diana scrap people broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure 
like that you know enough
The answer short answer to all those questions is yes
Yes I'm afraid of all those things
And I always have been
And I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can even guess at
Like I'm seaweed and other things that are scary
But when it comes to writing it the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why
You know is it rational
Is it logical that are anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do
You know I am and what is it specifically about creative ventures the seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health and a way that other careers kind of don't do you know
Like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know
Which is didn't come like get chemical engineering blocked John you know has a cult and
It's just having come up like that you know
But to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressive SS
We writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and that not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable ol
And you know you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the twentieth century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seemed to be really undone by their CAFS you know 
Norman Mailer just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more 
an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always alternately lead to anguish
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um Are you guys all cool with that idea
Are you comfortable with that because and you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption
I think it's odious
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century
I think better if we encourage you know our great Creator minds to live
And I definitely know that in my case in my situation and it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career
Which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about forty years old
I still have maybe another for decades of work left in me
And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right
And I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me
No Se Jesus what a hot
You know like that's the kind of thought they could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and you know I don't want to go the her
You know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love
And so the question becomes how
And end so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct Ray
I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on
And as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help on creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of of creativity
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome
So stay with me because it does circle around back
But ancient Chris and injure Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then OK
people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and then noble reasons
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirit of creativity Damon's
Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar
The Romans had the same idea but they called that's sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius
Which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual
I believe that a genius was to sort of magical divine entity who wasn't believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio kind of like Dobie the house elf and who would come out and serve invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work
So brilliant There it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned right
So the ancient artists was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right
If your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like to somebody genius who had helped you
If your work bombs not entirely your fault you know 
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame
And that this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the he individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine
And it's beginning of rational humanism and you don people started believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual
And for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius
And I gotta tell you I think that was a huge error
You know I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidt GE too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche
It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun
You know it's just completely warped and distorts egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years
And and if this is true and I think it is true the question becomes What now
You know Can we do this differently
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery
maybe not
Maybe we can't just race five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighty minute speech
And there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like it's rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff
A game not probably going to bring you all along with me on this
but that the question had kind and want to pose is you know why not
Why not think about it this way 
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capricious notes of the creative process
process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally 
And in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal
And I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth stolen who's now in her nineties but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the field and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape
She said it was like a thunderous train of air
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape
And when she felt it coming because it looks shake the earth under her feet
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell
And she would run like hell the house and she beating chase by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and I'm and grab it on the page
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for an other poet
And now and and then there were these times it This is the piece I never forgot she said that there are moments when she would almost miss it right
So she's like running in the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it
to catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page
And in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first
So when I heard that I was like at on built you know it's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like
It's not all of my creative process I'm not the pipeline you
Like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is they have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly 
But even I in my mule Ischinger is even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times
I would imagine that a lot of you have to
You know like even I have had worker ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify
And what is that thing
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us sane
And for me the best contemporary example that have a how to do that and is the musician Tom Waits who I got to interview and several years ago on a magazine Simon
We were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalised
But then he got older he got calmer and one day he was driving on the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is where it all change for him
And now I'm and he's like speeding along and also the here's this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tantalizing anyone sit you know it's gorgeous and And he longs for but he has no way to get a
He doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil doesn't have a tape recorder
So he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm gonna lose this thing you know I'm and then to be haunted by the some forever
I'm not good enough I can't do it
And instead of panicking he just stop
He just start that whole mental process and he did something completely novel
He just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me Can you not see that I'm driving
Do I look like I can write down a song right now you know
If you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you
otherwise go bother somebody else today
Go father Leonard Cohen
And in his whole work process changed after that
Not the worked the work was still leak oftentimes as dark as ever
But the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him were was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realize that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing
It could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom
So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once
This idea it's saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something that's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this could be the worst book ever written
not just bad but the worst book ever written
And I'm and I sort of think I should just dump this project
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I talk I tried it
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room
And I said aloud listen you thing on you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't having more than this
So if you want to be better than you guys show up and do your part of the deal
OK but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it
going to keep writing anyway because that's my job
And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job
Because in the end it's like this and pay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right
But every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent
And I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point your life for performance like this
And it was like time would stop and the dancer which are step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he'd ever done you know a thousand nights before but everything would align
And all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human 
He would be like lit from within and lit from below and all the glitz up on fire with divinity 
And when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name
they would put their hands together and they would start to chant all our Allah Allah God guide God
That's God you know
curious historical footnote when the Moore's invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah a lot to allay ole ole which you still here in bullfights and then flamenco dancers
in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and magic are la la la alot magnificent Bravo in comprehensible there it is a glimpse of God
Which is great because we need that
But the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday eleven a m and he's no longer a glimpse of God
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again
And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spends and what is he then to do with the rest of his life
This is hard
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make an of creative life
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you
But maybe if you just believe that they were on loan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else
And you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything
You know this is how I've started to think in this is certainly how is thinking about it in the last few months you know as some I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated follow up to my arm freakish success
And and what I have to sort of keep telling my his self when I get really psyched out about that is on don't be afraid
Don't be daunted
Just do your job
continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be
If your job is to dance do your dance
If the divine cock eyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts than Ole
And if not do your dance anyhow
And Ole to you nonetheless
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it
Ole to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up

Thank you

Here I show these to slide said that demonstrate that the Arctic ice cap which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has shrunk by forty percent
But this under states the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice
the Arctic ice cap is in a sense the beating heart of the global climate system
it expands in winter and contracts in summer
The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast forward of what's happened over the last twenty five years
the permanent ice is marked in red
And as you see it expands to the dark well that's the annual ice in winter and it contracts in summer
The so called permanent ice five years old or older you can see it's almost like blood spilling out of the body here
in twenty five years it's gone from this to this
This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which when it thaws is turned into methane by microbes
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount could double if we cross this tipping point
already in some shallow lakes in Alaska methane is actively bubbling up out of the water
Professor Katie Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter

She's OK or the question is whether we will be
And one reason is this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north
This is an annual melting River
But the volumes are much larger than ever
This is the kangaroo lose sick River in southwest Greenland
If you want to know how sea level rises from land based ice melting this is where it reaches the sea
These flows are increasing very rapidly
At the other end of the planet Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance
And West Antarctica propped up on tops of undersea Islands is particularly rapid in its melting
That's equal to twenty feet of sea level as is Greenland
In the Himalayas the third largest mass of ice at the top you see new lakes which a few years ago where glaciers
Forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow
And the Andes this glacier is the source of drinking water for the city
The flows have increased
But when they go away so does much of the drinking water
In California there's been a forty percent decline in this year's snow pack
This is hitting the reservoirs
And the predictions as you've read are serious
This drying around the world has led to a dramatic increase in fires
And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate
four times as many in the last thirty years as in the previous seventy five
This is a completely unsustainable pattern
If you look at it in the context of history you can see what this is doing
In the last five years we've added seventy million tons of CEO to every twenty four hours twenty five million tons every day to the oceans
look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific from the Americas extending westward and on either side of the Indian sub continent where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans
the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is twenty percent of it is the burning of fossil fuels
oil is a problem and coal is the most serious problem
The United States is one of the two largest emitters along with China
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants
But we're beginning to see a sea change
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives of propose
However there is a political battle in our country
And the coal industry's and the oil industry spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal which is an oxymoron
That image reminded me of something
around Christmas in my home in Tennessee a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled
You probably saw it on the news
This all over the country is the second largest waste stream in America
This happened around Christmas
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this
And see what happens 
You are
I see the green room
If you were and are on the case he said
This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia
The largest the mountain top minor is the head of Massey Coal
Let me be clear about Al Gore which Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid and I don't know what they're talking about
So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched the two campaigns
This is so one of them part of one of them
All energy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business
That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about goal
The fact is coal isn't dirty
We think it's clean smells good too
So don't worry about climate change
the background ones
wrinkle heard a lot of bad
So let's take a tour of the stately are clean coal facility
You amazing 
But then I got technology
Her Nicole is one of the leading causes of global warming the remarkable they got technology you hear changes everything
They got this is clean coal technology
Finally the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge
Eric is in crisis the kind of national security climate crisis
the thread that links them all our addiction to carbon based fuels like a pretty cool feeling on
Now there's a bold new solutions to get us out of this mess
How America with one hundred percent clean electricity within ten years
planned America back to work to make us more secure upstart global
Finally a solution it's big enough to solve our problems me
Power America find out more
This is the last one
You about every power in there
When the fastest ways to cut our dependence on all dirty fuels killing our planet
features over here when the sun and no energy grid
new investments to create high paying jobs
We power and their stand get real
There's an old African proverb that says If you want to go quickly go alone
If you want to go far go together
We need to go far quickly
Thank you very much
always start by asking you to think back to when you're a kid playing with blocks
Is he figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you're actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us
So as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser Patti and my collaborator D even calamity I started to wonder what if when we use a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by buildings of tools
In a nutshell a sift Abul as an interactive computer the size of a cookie
They're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can censor motion and ever screen and a wireless radio
Most importantly their physical select the blocks you can move than just by reaching out and grasping
And that's if the balls are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information
And as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and find interaction styles
So I'm going to start with some simple examples
This after was configured to show video and if I tilt in one direction who roll the video this way for tilted the other way and rolls it backwards
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other
So if I put them next to each other they get interested
If they get surrounded they notice that to make it a little flustered
And they can also sense their motion and tell
One of the interesting implications are interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data like pouring a color the way we might pour liquid
So in this case we've got three sifted was configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to poor color into that central and where they get next
We overshoot we can pour a little bit back
There are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games we want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately
So here I am This is a divinity sequence that I'm making a simple equation program
Here we have a word game it's kind of like a mash up between Scrabble and bottle
Basically in every round you get a randomly assign letter and sift Abul and as you try to make words it checks against dictionary
And after about thirty seconds it re shuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities crime
Thank you
So this is some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab and I managed to get them to try it out and shoot a video
You see what they're really loved it
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions
I have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do
So here's another few people trying out 
That's So youngest beta tester down there on the right
Turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the Sifton was up
So to him they're just blocks 
Now this is an interactive cartoon application
And what we wanted to build a learning tool for for language learners
And this is Felix actually
And you can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting settles off the table that have that character shown on them
There is bringing the sun out
It's sun is rising
Now is about a tractor into the scene
The orange tractor
The yeah
So by shaking the sensible xA putting next to each other he can make the characters interact
inventing his own narrative
No
It's an open ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds
What are you can't 
So the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we don't recently in which Sifton was act as sounds like lead base and drums
Each of these has four different variations you get to choose which one you want to use
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want
And you know Jack did by just bumping up the sounds of war against the sequence of the war
There are effects that you can control live like riverbed and filter
you attach it to a particular sound until to adjust it
And then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence
So let's have a look
start by putting a lead into to sequence of divorce arrange them into a series of extended add a little more lead
Now put a baseline in
Now put some percussion in
You can now attach the filter to the drugs I can control distract life
I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to one one way or the other
Now attach the filter to the base for some more expression
I can rearrange the sequence while place
I don't have to plan it in advance but I can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as I go
And now finally I can fiddle sequence out using the volumes of double tilted to the left
Thank you
So as you can see my passions for making new human computer interfaces that are better matched to the ways our brains and bodies work
And today had time to show you one point in this new design space and a few of the possibilities or working to bring out a laboratory
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information in to our world on our terms
Thank you very much
I look forward to talking at all
and talks about happiness these that a
i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers
there is a lot of happiness coaching
everybody would like to make people happier
but in spite of all this flood of work and there are several cognitive traps that would make it almost impossible to think straight about happens
and my talk today will be mostly about these scope of traps
this applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else's
and the first of these drop is a reluctance to admit complexity
it turns out that the word happiness is just a useful word anymore because we applied to too many different things
i think there is one particular meaningful to which we might restricted but by and large this is something that will have to give up and will have to adopt the more complicated view of what will be news
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about her life happy with your life
and those are two very different concepts and they're both slumped in the notion of happiness
and the third is it's the focusing and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects will be without distorting its importance
mean this is a real problem that trap
there's just no way of getting one
now i'd like to start with an example of somebody with a question and answer session after one of my lectures who reported story
he said he had been listening to a symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching set
and then he added new to quite emotionally it ruined the whole experience
but the happened
when it had ruined when the memory of the experience
he had had the experience
he had had twenty minutes of glorious music
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was told that he had gotten heat
when this is telling us really is that you might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of true selves
and there was an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present capable of reliving the past the basically it has only the present
it's experiencing self of the doctor approaches you know when the doctor 's does it look now when a pattern here
and then there is a remembering self and remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches and asking the question of how have you been feeling lately
how was your trip to binyam or something like that
those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the eight and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness
now that remembering self is a storyteller
and that really starts with the basic response of all memory starts immediately
we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories
our memory tells a story that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
and let me begin with one example
this is an old study
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure
i won't go into detail there it's longer painful these days but it was painful when the six when the study was run in the nineteen nineties
there s to report on their pain every sixty seconds
and here are two patients
those are their their recordings
and you are us who of them suffered more
and it's a very easy question
clearly patiently suffered more
his p was longer and every and minute of pain that patient they have they should be had and more
but now there is another question how much he these patient faint flakes off
and here is the supporters and the surprises that patient a had a much worse memory of the koran of scrapie them impatiently
the stories of the an most of these with different and biko's of very critical part of the story is how we aims and neither of these stories is very inspiring to great but of but one of them is this thing
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other
and the one that is worse than the one where payne was at its peak at the very end
it's a bad story
how do we know that
because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later to how bad was the whole thing in total
and it was much worse for pay them for in in memory
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembrance
from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly be at a worse time
now what you could do with patient eight and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it doesn't work you could actually the offs could be of patient day by just keeping that you've been without drinking it too much
that will that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before
and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off and you made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have and outpatient a with a better story about his experience
but defines a story
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up
when defines a story oct changes significant moments and endings
and things are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated
now i'm experiencing self lives its life continues
has moments of experience one after the other
and you can ask what happens to these moments
and the answer is really straightforward
they're lost forever
the most of the moments of all life and i calculated another psychological presence is said to be about three seconds long
that means that you know an inner life there about six hundred million of them
the months for about six hundred thousand
most of them don't leave a trace
most of them completely ignored by the remembering self
and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience his own life
it's a finite resource that we're spending when we're on the earth
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that are remembering self keeps for us
so we have some remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of power
from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation
that's not the way it works at all for the remembrance cell
for the remembering self a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories ad
you have not changed the story
and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes our remembering self from our experiences
time has very little impact on the story
now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories
it is actually the one that makes the citizens because if you have a patient was had safe to an oscar piece was two different rooms and is deciding which of them to choose then the one that uses of the one that has been know the memory that is less about and that's the truth of the of that will be chosen
the experiencing self have no voice in the schools
we actually don't choose between experience
we choose between memories and experiences
and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences
we think of our future as anticipated memories
and basically you can look at this and a tyranny of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering sort sort of dragging the experiencing self to is that the experience self doesn't need
i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we we go on vacations to a very large extent in the world has a low remembering self
and this is a bit to justify thick
they how much we consume all memories
that is one of the explanation that is given for the dominance of the remembering self
and when i think about that i think about the vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago which was clearly the best vacation of hot and i think of a drug that we often relative to how much i think of other vacations
and i'd probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years
now i if i had and will open the folder with a six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour
now that is three weeks and that is that most an hour and a half
there seems to be a discrepancy
i may be a bit extreme in and how little appetite i have for consuming memories that even if you do more of us there is a genuine question
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences
so i want you to think about a thought experiment
imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the day vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amazing drop so that you won't remember anything
now would you choose the same vacation
and end if and if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between the two cells and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one ends
and if you think in terms of of memories you might get another answer
why do we make them there publications we do is a problem that confronts us to know with the choice between the two cells
now the true selves bring up to notions of happiness
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one pro self
so you can ask how happy is the experience himself
and then you would ask are happy of the moments in the experiencing 's life
and they're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process
all the emotions that can be measured
and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self the time
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering stuff it's a completely different way
this is not about how happy a personal lives
it is about how satisfied are please the person is when that person thinks about her life
very different notion
anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of being who'd been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way
that the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognised in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallup organization has a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences
and there have been other efforts along those lines
so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two cells
and then main lesson i think that we have a is that there are really do different
you can know are satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happy they are living them life and vice versa
just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about point flight
with that means is if you met somebody and you were told all his father is six feet tall with how much would you know about his height
well you would know something about this height but there's is a lot of uncertainty
you have that much uncertainty
if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing cells
so the correlation is real
we know something about what control satisfaction of the happiness self
we know that money is very important goals of their import
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like
there other pleasures of this is dominant
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the true selves you are going to end up doing very different things
the bottom line of i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness that as a substitute for well being
it is a completely different notion
now very quickly another reason we cannot sphinx draped about happiness is that we do not in the center of the same things when we think about life and we actually live
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california and are not going to get to the correct answer
when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if you say you live in ohio
and and what happens is when you think about living in california you up thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrasts azin in climate
well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people off
but now because the reflective self isn't truong you may end up some people may end up moving to california
and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who moved to california in the hope of getting happier
well they're experiencing self is not going to get happy
we know that
but one thing will happen they will think are happy he because when they think about it then be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
and they will feel they made the right decision
it is very difficult to think straight about well being and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it
i
thank
thank you so much
now when we're on the phone and weeks ago and you mentioned to me that and those are interesting result came says of that gallup survey
that is something that you can has to do with a of stuff
sure
i think the most interesting result that we found in the galaxy of is a number which we absolutely did not expect before
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self
when you know we looked at heart house feelings very within cop
and it turns out that the low income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand it's a lovely presented itself the the loan income of six hundred thousand dollars a year
sixty thousand
six years
sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappy at the poor of the
above that we get the absolute the flat line
i mean i really see alliance so far
clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly by the misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly
in terms of this the other self the remembering self you get a different story
the more money you are the most satisfied
that does not hold for a month
danity the whole american endeavor is about you know life in the pursuit of happiness
if people took him seriously that finding and it magazines did hang upside down everything we believe about like for example taxation policy and so forth
is it is a great chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding that seriously and public policy based on
know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research and public policy
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the uk it is happening in other countries it is happening
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
it's going to take a lot and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have a debate face soon how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think of whether you think of the remembering self we think of the experience
this is going to influence policy a thinking in years to come
in the united states efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population
this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of and statistics
while it it's that this issue well our nation paid the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics
the pentagon
i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for the time wired
i always keep my stars in the never writing anything that i r finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find
i mean greedy the entry
disabled adjective is crippled helpless useless racked stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated rundown worn out weekend impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped scene senile decrepit that lay down a done for done and cracked up counted out see also hurt useless and weak
and antinomies healthy strong capable
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was a laughing it's so best but had just gotten have mangled and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and an impact that the hope from these words unleashed
in a this is my raggedy the stars
i'm thinking this must be an ancient printing right
but in fact the eight was the early nineteen eighties when i have been they're starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me
and needless to say thank god i wasn't using as thesaurus as then
and from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever ever going for them when in fact today i'm celebrated for and the opportunities and adventures my life have tier
so am i immediately went to look at the two thousand nine on line edition who expecting to find a revision worth noting
here's the updated version of this century
unfortunately it's not that much better
i find the the last two words under near ants nims particularly unsettling hole and wholesome
so it's not just about the words
it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words
about the values behind the words and how we construct those values
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other their people
in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and romans believed that two other curves verbal he was so powerful because to save the thing out loud brought it into existence
so what reality do we want to call into existence the person who is limited or person 's empowered
actually actually doing something as simple as naming a person a child we might be putting lives and casting shadows on their power
when we want to open doors for them instead
one such person open doors for me was my childhood doctor at the they i com institute in wilmington delaware
his name is doctor peter too low
i'm telling americans name of happiness too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by dr p
and dr p always are really colorful bow ties and then had a very perfect this position to work with children
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
i had to do what seem like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands and different colors you know to help build up my leg muscles
and i hated these bands more than anything
i hated them had named them actually to them
and i know i was already bargaining at the five year old child with dr peter try to get out a doing his exercises unsuccessfully of course
and one day he came in to my session and exhaustive and unforgiving the sessions and he said to me why aimee you're such a strong powerful little girl i think you're going to break one of those bands
when you do break it and give you a hundred bucks
now course this this was the simple ploy and doctor p party get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward but what he effectively did for me was reshaped and awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
in in previous instances of those the star s entry in our languages and not allowing us to ball into the reality that we would all want the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have brought about by technology
certainly from a medical by my legs and in a laser surgery for vision impairments at titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature is imposed on them not to mention social networking platforms allows people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go aligned with global groups of their own choosing
so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a troops that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset
the human ability to adapt an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and come in and make an admission
this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt an easy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience at this my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pick called the life of prosthetic for what other people perceive as my disability
but in fact we are changed who we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both
in ominously just that this is a good thing
adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living my life
it's part of our life
and i tend to think of it like my shadow
sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
i certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the way of a person struggle
there is diversity in challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not get any adversity but how you're going to need it
so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not and disabled
and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their lives we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable somen
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in and and how do we fix it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself
by not treating the mess of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
we are effectively grading someone's works to our community
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times is something we want to avoid for sweep under the rug then said to find those opportunities wrapped the adversity
so maybe the idea that would have put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with that 's wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful where less burdened by the presence of it
this year we celebrate the two hundred birthday of charles darwin and with a hundred fifty years ago when writing about evolution the darwin illustrated i think the truth about the human character
to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent but survived it is the one that is most adaptable to change
conflict is the genesis of creation
from darwin's work amongst others we can recognise that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation
so again transformation adaptation is our greatest human scale
and perhaps you know until we tested we know were made of
maybe that adversity gives us a sense of self defence of our own power
so we can give ourselves against
we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
maybe we can see this change
adversity is just change that we have an adapted ourselves to yet
i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
it know what
there's no normal
there's common there's typical there's no normal
and would you when i meet that poor based person if they existed
don't think so
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one a possibility or potency be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community
anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people prove their value to the community they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
thirty years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania i getting over a bushel of tomatoes
the summer time had shorts on
i under this guy his voice behind they say well if it isn't aimee mullins
i turn around and as is older man i have no idea who he is
and i said and i'm sorry sir i don't having men i don't remember meeting him
he said what you would remember meeting me
i mean when we met i was delivering the from your mother's womb
so the eye
and of course actually it did click
this man was doctor team and man died only known about my mother's stories of that day because of course typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks
and so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me as a complete stranger to my parents
and because i was born without fibula bones and had he turned in a few toes in this but because and that he had be there the stranger had to be the bearer of bad news
he said to me who i had to give this prognosis to your parents that he would never walk and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of of independence and even making a liar adding me ever since
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts of the other halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my in sports victories and he was using it in integrating into teaching resident students med students from common medical school and hershey medical school
and he called this part of the course the x factor as potential of the human will
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
and doctor king went on to tell me that he said in my experience and less repeatedly told otherwise and even if given a modern modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
to doctor king made that shift in thinking
he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
there's been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prospects for and bone leg i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
i aspired to that kind of normalcy come back again
if he asked me today not so sure
and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lives and cast shadows on me
all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and your off
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power of the human spirit is so respected if you can do that open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
the teaching them to open doors for themselves
fact the the exact meaning of the word educate comes in every word reduce
it means to bring forth what is him to bring out potential
so again which potential do we want to bring out
there is a case study done in nineteen sixty britain when they were moving from country our grammar schools to comprehensive school
of the streaming trials we caught tracking here in the states
it separating students from a the cd and so on
and yet a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers accept
what that took covers three month period the level students gave maines told them they were raised told them they were bright
at the end of this three month period they were performing at a level
this course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took a students and told them they were d
and that's what happens at the end of that three month period
those who were still around in school size to drop people have dropped out
this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were to two
the teachers that now which had been made
they were simply told these are the a students visa the d students
and that's how they went about teaching them and treating them
so i think that the only true disability is a crash spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope
it doesn't see beauty
it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity in our innate ability to imagine
if instead we can bolster human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power while
when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
i'd like to leave you with a poem by fourteen century persian poet name hafetz to my friends got them was me about
and a is called the guide who only knows for words
every child has known god not the god of names not the dotted don't but the guide who only knows for words and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come to dance with me
thank you
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is about something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real
in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies of the placebo effect just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or on some sort of a
for pain management for example if they believe that enough there's a measurable effect on the body called the placebo effect
something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it are
in order for us to understand each other i will start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick
and i show you how it works as a trick that's been in every children's magic books since at least the nineteen fifties
i learned myself from cup scout magic in the nineteen seventies
i'll do for you and i'll explain it
and then i'll explain why i explained
so i here's that
life which you could examine my hand which you could examine
this will hold the knife in my face like this
and i get my sleeve back
and that to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i'm squeezing their nothing can go up or down my sleeve
the object of this is quite simple
i'm going to open my hand and hopefully falls well might puer animal magnetism will hold the knife
in fact it's held so tightly in place so i can shake it and the knife does not come off
nothing goes up or down my sleeve school preparing and you can examine everything
no
so this effect that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though it's a very simple trick methodological
probably many of you in the room no district
about what happens is this
told the knife in my hand
i say i'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie
the reason i'm holding on to my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion
in a moment when my hand moves from facing new to being away from you this finger here my index finger just a shift from where it is to a position running out like this
nice work
someone who didn't have a childhood is out there
so it goes like this from here right
and as i move around my finger ships
we can talk about why this is deceptive why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mine in the way it processes information it doesn't count one two three groups them
but that's not really what this is about right and i open my hand
obviously it's cleaning they're not by animal magnetism but by chicanery index finger being there
and then when i close my finger same thing as i moved back this motion can covers stubbly back my finger
i take this hand away because the knife out
there's a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors impact
now what was that have to do with the placebo effect
i read a study are a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open
i'm not a doctor or researchers of this to me it was an astonishing thing
turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that's like aspirin shapes just around white built it has some certain measurable effect
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color blue and stamp a letter into it is it actually measurably more effective
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical placed their shoulder belts
but white pill is not as good as a pill
what that really what we out
turns out though that that's not even when it stops
if you armed have capsules they're more effective than tablets in any form
colored capsule that yellow on one end and read on the other is better than a white caps
dosage has something to do with this
one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills i don't remember the statistics
but the point is
these dosages have something to do with it
and the form has something to
if you want the ultimate in a placebo you go to the needle
right a syringe was some inner couple ccs of an or something in you inject this into a patient
well this is such a powerful image in their mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill
it's really this graph on welsh ot of some other time we have slides
point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality
it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect
i want to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick
and take something that is obviously a fake tract and make it seem real
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle
this is a seven inch happen and it's very very sharp
and i'm going to sterilize a tiny bit
this is really my flesh this is not being damien's special grown flesh
that's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect
i'm going to pierce my skin and the run this legal through to the other side
if you're queasy can at if you're if you think he i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night some people but i didn't know and one woman almost passed out
so i suggest if you're if you get queasy easy to look away for about the next thirty effect in on all the first bad are behind
you'll get to see you can look away to have it like that
so here's what happens right here at the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little peirce
i'm sorry them might freaking out of
and then she through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
now essentially were in the same position we were in with the knife trick
sort
but you can count my fingers right now kenya 's
we shouldn t that's one two three four five
a answer
i know what people think when they see this
they go well he would certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
so may give you little peek
said look out there good
yeah i know
at the people in the back ok i didn't really see the
people and satellite rumor like starting to move in now
they give you a good close look at this
that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect
that's my flesh and like can entwistle around
sorry if you're getting queasy look away to look at that
and on the back are people on video years are now watching the civil away that looks kind of neat and in some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be seen as a whole there a whole if it were real he would be believed
only work up blood for you
this is the w c d and
normally now i would take in lab
would clean arm i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real i'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
i will be seeing it several times over the next few days
i hope you're looking forward to that day you
i know ve game designer
i've been making games online now for ten years
and that my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to see the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games
now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games
some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games
maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world
and that actually according to my research at the institute for the future at it's actually the opposite is true
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems
and in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically
i've calculated the total we need a twenty one billion hours of game play every week
so that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idly ideas so all just i'll say it again let it sink in
if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict the city i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week the end the next decade
i'm serious i am
here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species through it
this is a portrayed by a photographer named phil pulled on a
he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming
so he said the camera in front of gamers while they were playing
and this is a classic gaming motion
now i a gamer you might miss some nuance in this photo
you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem
and if you are a game where you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the rise up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism
and frills up his surprise
this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win
well you've heard them have a
so we have some gamers among us
and that way and it is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea was even possible until you achieve debt
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you truly capable up that an epic way
this is a game are on the verge of being an epic win
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of solvers is all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century
the as someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win
now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems
this is what i call the i not good at like face
and and is actually mean making it can easy basket
this actually mean making the i'm not good at life face
this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd the on why we're better in games that we are in real life
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games
and i don't mean just good isn't successful although that's part of it
we do achieve more in game worlds also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and cooperate
and when think team worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at moment's notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again
arm and in real life when we when in we face failure when we can find obstacles we often don't feel that way
we feel overcome
we feel overwhelmed
we feel anxious maybe depressed frustrated or cynical
we never have this feeling summer playing games they just on existing games
so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work
so look at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment
and i started to notice a few things that make at epic win so possible in online worlds
so the first thing is when every show up monday 's online games especially in world of warcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with the world saving mission right away
but not just any mission as a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right
so you can do it
he never give you a challenge that you can achieve
but it is on the verge of what you're capable of so you have to try harder
but there is no unemployment and world of warcraft
there's no sitting around wringing your hands
there's always something specific and important to be done
and there are also of plant breeders
everywhere you got hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your at the commission
that's not something we have in real life that easily the sense that at our fingertips are tons of clad breeders
and also this is epic story this inspiring story of i were there and what we're doing
and the media all this positive feedback
guys have heard of leveling up in plus one strengthen plus want intelligence
how we kind of constant feedback in real life
i get up the seeds and not that i have your class one in class lyon crazy idea and plus twenty crazy idea
and i don't get that feedback in real life
now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic when all the time that we decide to spend our time in these game world
this is better than reality
so so far and collectively all the world of warcraft demers has spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of as rock
now that's not necessarily a bad thing
it might sound like it's about them
but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up
was the first uprights primate
ok so when we talk about how much time are currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution arm which is an extraordinary thing
but it's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games were actually changing what are capable of as human beings
we're evolving to be a more collaborative and hardy species
this is true i believe this
so consider this really interesting statistic
was recently published by researcher at carnegie mellon university
the average young person today in a country with a strong team or culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one
about ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons
first of all for children in the united states ten thousand eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as you're learning about everything else in school
and of have probably read malcolm can gladwell 's new book outliers
so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand our theory of success
it's based on this great pride in a science and research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effort for seti at anything by the age of twenty one and we will be virtuous as that
will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world
on and so now we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso beamers
so the big question is what exactly are gamers getting so good that
because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
this is how many people we now have in the world to spend at least an hour a day playing online games
these are virtuoso teamers
five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something
and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that it
if you don't know it already this is coming
game industry is developing consul several low energy and that work with a wireless phone networks instead of our broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india china brazil can get online
expect one billion more numerous in the next decade
something up to one point five billion gamers
so i started to think about what these games are making as virtuous as that
here the four things i came up with the first is urgent optimism
they think of this as extreme self motivation
urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
gamers always believe that that the point is possible and and is always worth trying and trying now
in sit around
gamers are virtuous those and weaving a tight social fabric
it's a lot of interesting research that shows that we'd like people better after we play game of them even if they've beaten us badly
the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play game with someone
we trust that they will spend their time with us they will play by the same rules value the same goal will stay with the team until it's over
and so the game together actually builds up bonds in trust and cooperation
and and then we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
blissful productivity and love it
is a reason why the average world of work have gamer plays for twenty two hours a week and a half time job
it's because we know when we're playing a game that are actually happier working hard then we are relaxing or hanging out
we know that we're optimizes human beings to do to meaningful work
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time they're given the right work
finally at the convening
gamers love to be attached to our inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories
so does one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective
to you all know wikipedia biggest week in the world
second biggest which in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of work after wiki
five million people use it every month
they've compiled for more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other with in the world
they are building an epic story
they are building a big knowledge resource about the world of warcraft
ok of these are for superpowers that had up to one thing
gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals
these are people who believe that their individually capable of changing the world
and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world
that's a problem that i'm trying to solve
and there's an economist in ever casanova over
this work is really it he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds
and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds on nineteen environments
and 's an economist so he 's rational
and he says
not like me on a game designer and exuberant
but he says he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online world and they can in real life
they can have stronger social relationships in games and they can have in real life
they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life
so he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds in the real world
now i also agree that that is rational for now
but it is not by any means an optimal situation
we have to start making the real world walk more like a game
so i take my inspiration from something that happened twenty five hundred years ago
these are ancient ice made out of 's knuckles right
before we had awesome and game controllers we had seen those
and that these are present the first game equipment designed by human beings
and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian her products s you might know this history
and which is a history of who invented games and walk
writer says that teams particularly dei games were invented in the kingdom of libya during a time of famine
apparently there is such a severe famine that the king of lydia decided they had to do something crazy
people were suffering people were fighting
it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
so according to privatise the invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
on one day everybody would eat
and on the next day everybody would play games
and he would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and says in such satisfying blissful productivity they would ignore the fact they had no food to eat
and then on the next day they would play games
and on the next day they would eat
according to process the past eighteen years this way surviving they were famine that eating on one day and playing games on the next
now this is exactly i think how we're using games today
we're using games to escape real world suffering
we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment everything that's not satisfied about real life and we're getting what we need from games
but it doesn't have to end there
this is really exciting
according to hot excess after eighteen years the famine was in getting better so the king decided they would play one final based pasting
they divided the tire kingdom in half
they played one day dynasty and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure
they would leave libya and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people to survive and the resources that were available and hopefully to take a civilization somewhere else where they could thrive
now this sounds crazy right
but recently dna evidence has shown that the atrocity ends who then led to the roman empire actually share the same dna as a two ants
and so recently scientists have suggested that this is crazy story is actually true
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could explain the famine
so this crazy story might be true
they have actually saved their culture by playing games this deep into games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and i knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually save the entire civilization
okay we can do that
we've playing half since nineteen ninety four
that was the first time strategy game from the world of warcraft series that was sixteen years ago
they played their schemes for eighteen years we complain or warpath for sixteen years
i say 're ready for own at the game
now they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world
so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play from
let's get half of us to agree to spend our day playing games until we solve real world problems
now i know you're asking how we innocent or problems in teens well that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
we have this banner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future
we do not want to try to predict the future
but we want to do is make the future
we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and we want to empower people to make that outcome to reality
we want to imagine at the wins and they give people the means to achieve the at epic when
and it's been a very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create capek wins in their own futures
this is a world without oil
we made this came in two thousand seven
this is an online game in which he tried to survive an oil shortage
the will is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to leave your real life as if we run out of oil so you come to the game you sign up you tell us where you live
and then we give you real time news videos to feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what's not available health food supplies being affected how transportation is being affected schools are closed if there's rioting
and you have to figure out how you live your real life as if this were true and we ask you to blog about it to post videos to post photos
the pilot this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand seven
and we tracked them for the three years since
and i can tell you that this is a trans formative experience
nobody wants to change how they live just because it's good for the world or because close to
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them you of oil
this is an amazing story an adventure for you to go on
challenge yourself to see how you would survive
most of our players have kept up the habits they were in this game
so for the next world saving him we to aim higher bigger problem than just peak oil
and we did a team called super stopped at the institute for the future
and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet
the supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course
we ask people to come on line almost like a jerry bruckheimer movie
new jerry bruckheimer movies it form a dream team
you've got the not a scientist ex convict and they have something to do to save the world
but in our game so does just having five people on the dream team we said everybody 's on the dream team and it's your job to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
we had a thousand people play that game for eight weeks
they came up with five hundred unseemly creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstar seeing
so finally the last game we're launching at march third this is a game than with the world bank institute
if you complete the game you will be certified by the world bank institute as a social innovator class of two thousand ten
working with universities all over subsaharan africa and are inviting them to learn social innovation skills
it's got a graphic novel we've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness
i would like to invite all of you to please share this again with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
sunday to wrap up now
and when asked the question
what do you think happens next
we've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved real world yet
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work that games are a powerful platform for change
we have all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity the ability to weave the tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for a big meaning
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter to survive on this planet for another century
and that's my hope that you will join me in making in playing games like this
when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want
so i say let the world changing games began
thank you
i'm going to talk today about energy and climate
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seats about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
the climate getting worse means that many years their crops on grow
they'll be too much rain not enough rain
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support
and that leads to starvation leads to uncertainty leads to rasped
also that the climate changes will be terrible for them
also the price of energy is very important to them
in fact you could pick just one thing the lower the price up to reduce poverty by far he would pick energy
now the price of energy has come down over time
really advanced civilization was based on an advances in in energy
the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution and even in nineteen hundreds we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make our modern materials and do so many things
and so were in a wonderful situation with our electricity in the rich world
but as we make it cheaper and let say 's go for making it drought as cheap we mean to mean a new constraint and that constraint has to do with ceo two
two is warming the planet and the equation on ceo two is actually a very straightforward one
you sum up the ceo to that gets cemented that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects
effects on the weather are perhaps worse the indirect effects in that of the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses
now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of sio two to what temperature be and where the positive feedbacks art there's some uncertainty there but not very much
and there's certainly uncertainty about how about those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
i asked the top scientists in this several times do we really have to get down to near zero
can't we just in a cut in half or quarter
and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise
and so that's that's a big challenge
it's very different than saying you know we're twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under
this is something that has to get to zero
now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year now over twenty six billion tons
our for each american it's about twenty times
for people in poor countries it's less than one time
an average about five times for everyone on the planet
and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero
it's been constantly going up
it's only various economic changes that have even it also have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero
this equation as four factors
a little bit of multiplication
so he got a thing on alessio ceo to the want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person using on average to energy on average for each service and the ceo to being put out a per unit of energy
so let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero
probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
and that's back to my school outgrew but let's let's take a look
firstly got population
of the world today has six point eight billion people
that's headed up to about nine billion
now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could deplore that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three
the second factor is the services we use
this encompasses everything the food we clothing tv he been
these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet
it's a great thing out for this number to go up
in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back in use last but every year this number on average is going to go up and so overall that will more than double the services delivered per person
here we have a very basic service
do you have light in your house to be able to read your homework can in fact these kids don't so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps
now efficiency the energy for each service are finally we have some good news
we have something that's not going up
through various inventions in new ways of doing lighting up through a different types of cars are different ways of building buildings
there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy to that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent
there are other services like how we make fertilizer how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
and so overall here before optimistic we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of sex
but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to it vast and maybe thirteen billion times and that just won't product
so let's look at this for factor and is going to be eighty one and this is the amount of sio to point out for each unit of energy
and so the question is can you actually get that to zero
if you burn coal no
you burn natural gas to
almost every way to make electricity today are except for the emerging renewables and nuclear are puts out sio two
and so we're going to have to do a global scale is create a new system
and so we need energy miracles
now why is the term miracle i don't mean something that's impossible
the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computers america all
on the internet and it services for miracle
so the people here participated in the creation of many miracles
usually don't have a deadline where have to get the miracle by a certain date
usually discounted standby and some come along some don't
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle and a a pretty tight timeline line
i thought how could i really capture this
is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration they would grab people's imagination here
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people enjoyed that
it really got them involved in the idea of a you know other people live mosquitoes
so when energy i to to come up with is this
our i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year
so here we have the something after five flies
until they don't bite infected might even not even believe that jar
now there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one out but they don't really add up to much
we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there's many directions or people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers
i've left out hide geothermal fusion in biofuels
those may make some contribution and that they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fine and we can't give up any of them are because they they look daunting because they all have significant challenges
well let's look first at the burning fossil fuels either a burning coal burning natural gas
we need to do their yeah seems like it might be simple but it's not and that's to take all the ceo to after you burn it going out the flu pressurize it create liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
now we have some pilot things that do this at the to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agree on where these sio two quality should be plot will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue
who's going to be sure
who's going to guarantee are something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste to think i've been in terms of nuclear other things
this is a lot of volume
so that's a tough one
next in the nuclear
it also has three big problems
costs particularly in highly regulated countries is high
the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that you know you have these human operators that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons
and then where would you do with the waste
although it's not very large and either a lot of concerns about that
people need it so good about it
so three very tough problems and that might be a solvable and so should be worked on
the last three of the five i grouped together
these are what people often referred to as the renewable sources
and they actually followed rate they don't file fuel they have some disadvantages
one is that the density and energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant
this is energy farm sear talking in not many square miles thousands of times more area than it than you think of as a normal energy plan
also these are intermittent sources
and the sun doesn't shine all day doesn't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn't blow all the time
and so the depend on the sources you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available
so we've got big cost challenges here
we have transmission challenges
for example say this energy sources outside your country are you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the rest of the energy coming from elsewhere
and finally the storage problem
in dimensionalize lies this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compare that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy
and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that's going to be a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now
it's not it's not impossible but it's not a very easy thing
now this shows up when you try to get there with the internet source to be a bob eight twenty to thirty percent of what you're using
if you're counting on it for a hundred percent you need to be an incredible miracle battery
now how we're going to go it on this what's what's the right approach
the manhattan project what's that the thing that can get us there
what we need lots of companies are working on this hundreds
in each of these five pass we need least four hundred people
a lot of a new look and say they're crazy and that's good
and i think here in a ted group we have many people are who are already pursuing this
and bill gross has several companies including one called the solar that has some great solar thermal technology
note coleslaw as investing in dozens of companies and are doing great things and have an interesting possibilities and am i'm trying to help backed that
and even where than i actually are backing in a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach
now there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there's some good ideas lane around on is not all that surprising
the idea of a terrible power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one per cent this year to thirty five we decided let's burn the ninety nine percent the u to thirty eight
it is kind of a crazy idea
in fact people have talked about for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and it's true the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach on this are looks like it would work
in because you're bringing that ninety nine percent a you have a greatly improved cost a profile
you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors
so instead of worrying about them you just take that it's a great thing
it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it's kind of like the candle
concedes it's a lot there are often referred to as a traveling wave reactor
in terms of fuel and this really solves the problem
i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky
this is the leftover of the ninety nine percent were they taken out the party burn now so called depleted uranium
that would power the u s for hundreds of years
and simply by filtering seawater and an inexpensive process you have enough fuel for the entire lifetime to the rest of the planet
so you know it's got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
so let's think how should we measure ourselves
what should our report card a look like
well let's go out to where we really need to get in and then a look at the intermediate
for twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about this he percent reduction
that really is very important that we get there
and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on poor countries still some agar culture
a hopefully we will have cleaned up a forestry cement
so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their me electricity generation altogether
so the other great is are we deploying this zero emission technology and we deployed in all the developed countries and we're in the process of of getting it up elsewhere
that super important
that's a key element of may making that report card
so backing up from their what should the twenty twenty report card look like
well it again it should have the two elements
now we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions
the less we met the last that some will be of ceo to and therefore the less the temperature
but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is that piece of innovation on these breakthroughs
these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed
there's a lot of great books the men written about this
the al gore book our choice and the david month mci book sustainable energy without the hot air
they really go through it i think can greater a framework that this can be discussed probably because we need broad backing for this
and there's a lot has to come together
so this is a wish
it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology
if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i can pick whose president i can pick the vaccine which is something i loved or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no sio two gets invented this is the wish i would pick
this is the one with the greatest impact
if we don't get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between us and china between four countries and rich and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse
so what do we have to do
why am i appealing attitude is a step forward in and drive
we needed to go for more research funding
and when countries get other places like a nation just discussed the ceo two
they should discuss this innovation agenda and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches
we do need the market incentives ceo to tax cap and trade something they get sapped price signal out there
we need to get the message out
we need to have this dialogue be more rational more understandable dialogue on including the steps that the government takes
this is an important with but it is one i think we can achieve
thank you
you
you
thank you from sit there and some more about about terrapower right and wing or what do sense was the scale of investment the business
they to actually do this software by the super computer hire all the great scientist which we've done that's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out are in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you'll only be up and hundreds of millions
the top thing is building a pilot reactor are in a several billion are finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these
once you get the first one built if it works as advertised and it is clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it
this to understand that it right this involves building deep into the ground in such a vertical column of nuclear fuel of this the spent uranium and then and then and then the process starts at the top kind of works down
that's right to beat you're always reviewing the reactor sea have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that they were opening it up and moving things in and out
that that's not good
so if you have a very very cheap fuel that you can put sixty years and just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities
and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years are and and then it's gone
it's that it's a nuclear power plant the is its own waste disposal solution
yeah what happens with the ways you can you can let it sit there are there's a lot less waste under this approach on then you can actually take that and put it into another one amber's unmapped
and and we start out actually by taking the waste that exist today that sitting in these cooling pools of dry and by reactor
that's our fuel to begin with
so the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed in our senior reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process
i mean you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is the most interested in actually doing something with this
where women has picked a particular place but are it is all these interesting disclosure rules about mean it's called nuclear and so we we we've got a lot of interest are the people from the company had in in russia india china
i've been vaccine the secretary of energy here talking about how this fits into the the energy agenda
some optimistic are in the french and japanese have done some work
this is a a variant on something that has been done
it's an important advance but it's like a fast reactor and a lot of come countries have built and so anybody used on a fast reactor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built
so in in your mind and time scale and likelihood of actually taking certain this life
what we need for one of these still electric electoral generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to the point
that's sort of the deadline that the environments animals environmental models of have shown us that we have to meet
it an terror power if things go well i'll which is pushing for a lot to be easily meet that
and there are unfortunately now dozens of companies we need the hundreds who likewise if their science goes well of they're funding for the plant pilot plans goes well that date they can compete for this
and it's basket multiple succeed because they need to use a makes a mix of these things
we certainly need one to succeed
mentions of big scale possible game changes that is the biggest that your aware about that
energy breakthrough is the the most important thing
it would didn't even without the environmental but the environmental constrictor snakes that seoul much are so much greater
in the nuclear space there are other innovators
and you know we don't know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people are that's a different approach
there's a liquid type reactor which seems a little harder maybe they say about us
i and there there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of state coal and so if you can deal with the natives have it's essentially the radiation the footprint in cost the potential in terms of the effect on land in various things is in almost every class of that song
if this doesn't work and then watch
do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable
yet he didn't that situation it's like if you're been overeating and you're about to have a heart attack
then where you go you may need heart surgery or something
there is a line of research on what's called geo engineering which are various techniques that would delay the heaney tobias twenty or thirty years to get our act together
now you hope that's an and polls
hope you don't need to do that
some people say some even work on interest costs because it might make you lazy that he'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you
i'm not sure that's wise given the importance of the problem but others now that the geo engineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in key things happen faster for this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect
climate skeptics if you had an sentence to to them how how might you persuade them that they're wrong
well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few
are the same that there's native feedback effects have to do with clouds that saplings things
are very very few things that they can even say you know there's a chance in a million of those things
the main one have here is kind like gains
you make a mistake now and paid for a lot later
and so when you have all sorts of the urgent problems the idea of taking pain now that has through the game later in a somewhat uncertain a painting
in fact the i p c c report you know that that's not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich will look like a c and say okay you know that that isn't that big a deal
the fact is it's the that uncertain part that should move us towards us
but my dream here is that you can make an economic and meet the sio two constraint then the skeptics say ok i don't care that doesn't about it like and we did to have too but i guess all except because it's cheaper than ever what's come before
so set out to a response to the that the bjorn mumbled argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve silversea to problem is going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty malaria is a four visits is that it's a stupid waste of the earth's resources to put money towards that when the other things we can do
the actual spending on the armed the 's and you know say the have spent ten billion year more than it is right now it's not that dramatic
action take away from other things
that then you get into big money on and this result deep industry is when you have months noneconomic intertwine to fund that
that's to me mostly is a waste
am you're very close and your just funding the learning curve it's going to get very cheap
i believe we should try a more are things that have the potential to be far less expensive
if a trade off you get into is let's make energy super and subaru are expensive then the rich can afford that
we all of us here could pave five times as much for energy not change our lifestyle
the disaster is for that two billion
and even one lomborg has changed
his state now is wise and the r d and getting more discussed he
he still because of his earlier stuff sort of associate with a skeptic camp but he's realized that's that's a pretty lonely and and so i he's making the r. the point
and and so there is a pile a thread of something that i think is appropriate
rmt pc it's crazy how little it funded
although i suspect i to on off of most people here to say i really hope you'll wish comes true thank you so much
thank you
phil i'm a lot of fish in my life
i've loved only two
at first one was that it was more like a passionate affair
it was a beautiful fish flavorful for textured needy a best seller on the menu
what a
even better it was farm raised to the suppose the highest standards of sustainability
so you can feel good about selling it
i was in our relationship with this beauty for several months
one day ahead of the company called and asked if i'd speak at event bought the farm sustainability
absolutely i said
here's a company trying to sell what's become this unimaginable problem for chefs
how we keep fish on our menus
for the past fifty years when the fishing the seas like we clear cut parts
it's hard to overstate the destruction
ninety percent a large fish the ones we love the tune is the how that's the sammons swordfish the collapsed
there was nothing left
so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming in part of our future
a lot of arguments against it
fish farms pollute most them doing and they're inefficient take tuna
major drawback
status feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farmed tuna
not very sustainable
and thanks very either
so here finally was a company trying to do it right
i want to support it
the day before the then i called the head of pr for the company
let's him down
as it is to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for filing so far out to sea you don't pollute
that's right he said were so far out the waste my fish gets distributed not concentrate
and then he added are basically a world unto ourselves
the conversion ratio two point five one he said
best in the business
two point five one great
the two but from what what what is food
sustainable proteins he said
great i said got off the phone
and then i was lying in bed i thought what the 's a sustainable protein
so the next day just before the event i called down
i said now what are some examples of sustainable proteins
so even though they ask around
when i got on the phone a few people in the company
no one can give me a straight answer
until finally i got on the phone with the head biologists
let's call him down to
i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins
or engines now analogies and sunfish males and many said chickened out
the chicken pellets
he said we have better skin bone meal scraps dryden and processed in sea
he said what percentage of your theme is chicken
thinking about two percent
was about thirty percent he said
as sit down what's sustainable about cleaning chicken in fish
but there is a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world
i fell out of love with this fish
no not because i'm some self righteous goody two shoes foodie
actually am
and i thought well the spanish because i swear to god after that conversation with this tasted like chicken
this set fish what's different kind of love story
it's the romantic guy the kind where the more you get to know your fish you the the fish
i first ate at a restaurant in southern spain
a journalist friend i'm talking about this fish for a long time
japan has set us up
they came to the table of bright almost shimmering white collar
the shaft and overcooked
i twice over
amazingly it was still delicious
who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked
i can with this guy can
let's call him media
actually his name is miguel
and not the corporate competition is not a staff
at least the way the u n i understand it
is a biologist and that i dhlakama
it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain
it said the tip the blot guadalquivir of the air river
until nineteen eighties the farmers in the hands of the argentinians
they raise beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands
they did it by draining land
they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
but couldn't make it work and economically
and ecologically it was a disaster
so like ninety percent of the birds which for this place a lot of birds
and so on nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchase the land
what do they do
the reversed the flow of water
they literally flip the switch
so the pushing water out the use the channels to pull water back in
they flooded the canals
they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish brushfire bastien lalanne sram yield any the process of me down and this company completely reversed ecological destruction
the is incredible
i mean you've never seen anything like this
stare at the horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooding canals and a bit rich marshland
i was there not long ago with media
is an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin in one part crocodile dundee
okay there we are sliding into the wetland in on panting and sweating on one up to my knees and gaels was calmly conducting a biology lecture
here is pointing out of rare black actually quite
now is mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton
and here theory sees grouping pattern their reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe
it turns out miguel spent the better part of his career in the whom the national park in africa
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish
said fish i run only about fish
i'm expert in relationships
then ease off launching into more talk about rare birds an is and strange aquatic plant
don't get me wrong i was really fascinating you now the biotic community unplugged kind of thing
you know it's great but i was in
and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before
so i interrupted by lessening gal what makes your fish taste so good
the point of the algae
i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships it's is amazing
but for what your fish needed
what's the feed conversion ratio
what was on to tell me it's such a rate system that the eating what the meaning in the wild
the plant bio mass the light like a in zooplankton and it's what feeds the fish
the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing
there is no fee
ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals
later that day i was driving around this property with me on the rise of replace seems so natural unlike any fish alligator farm i ever been out how do you measure success
at that moment it's as if the film director called for a sex change
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a little pink carpet for as as you could see
that success he said
look at the balance think
are these things
the thing of told his
week cap on the feasting on your fish
yes he said
we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to departs
i will last year this property had six hundred thousand birds are more than two hundred fifty different species
it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of europe
i said miguel is a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm
each should have said no
he said we farm extensively not intensively
this is an ecological network
the flamingos hepa to schremp
shrimp the fight like that
so the thinker the belly the better the system
ok so it's riviere
farmer doesn't of its animals on a farm and measures of success on the health of its predators
a fish farm but also bird sanctuary
on by the way those forming as they shouldn't even be there in the first place
they brewed in the town hundred fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests
every morning they fly one hundred fifty miles into the farm
and every evening if i were fifty miles back
they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two
no kidding
i was imagining a march of the penguins then you know so i looked at me
i said miguel do they fly one hundred fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred fifty miles back at night
do they do that for the children
he looked at me like i just a a whitney houston song
he said now they do because of foods better
i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i don't like fish skin
i don't like it here don't like crispy
set acrid tar like flavor
i was never cook with it
yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like the skin
it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean
i mention that in the gallery not
he said this skin and at this time
so last the fence before ending enters the body
the involved to soak up impurities
and then he added but our water has no impurities
ok a farmer doesn't feed its fish
a farm that measures 's success by the success of its predators
and then i realize when he says a farmer has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the blood guadalquivir your river
a river carries with it all the things the rivers can be carried these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff
and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered
the system is so healthy it purifies the water
so not just a farmer doesn't few thousand i'm just a foreigner measures the health made success by the health of its predators but a as literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well
because without water leaves dumps out into the atlantic
a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive
you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about mass or beef cattle
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
for a lot of people that's a bit too radical
were not real us foodies
when lovers
we love farmers markets
we have small family farms
we talk about local food
we organic
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey gas and well a pink flamingos i don't feed the world
i can see the world
and i'll be honest
i don't love that question
no not because we are already produce enough calories to more than feed the world
one billion people will go hungry today
one billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities in distribution not peniche
i don't love this question because as the the logic of our food system the last fifty years
feed grain herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil shaken a fish and all long agribusiness has simply asked if for few more people more cheaply how terrible could that day
that's been the motivation spend the justification it's been the business plan of american agriculture
we should call it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible
as of business and is agriculture
our bread basket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
not by the latest come combine a tractor invention but by fertile land not by comscore from by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forest and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea
point of the world
let's start by asking how you feel yourselves
or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself
to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future
it's really old and it's tired
it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good me
instead let's look to the ecological model
that's the one that relies on two million years of on the job experience
look to me gal farmers like media
farms that are worlds unto themselves farms that restore the senate deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively simply farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships
is they're the ones that are experts in flavor too
and if i'm going to be really honest they're better chef than however be
now i'm ok with that because it that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious
thank you
i grew up on steady diet of science fiction
and high school at i took a bus to school an hour each way every day
and the i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this are in in in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had
and you know that curiosity also manifests itself in in the that whatever in school i was i was out of the woods hiking in taking samples of frogs and snakes and bugs in pond water and bring it back looking at it under the microscope
was while real day
was all about trying to understand understand the world understand that the limits of of possibility
and my you know love of of science fiction actually seem to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties a you know we were we're going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans
jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places an all wonders world that we could never really have previously imagined
so that seem to resonate with the whole science fiction part of them
and i was on an artist
and i could draw like painted and
and i i found that because there were no video games and the saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images of my head
you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author's description put something on the on the screen the movie screen in our heads
and so my response to this was to paint to drop alien creatures alien world robot spaceships all that stuff
was endlessly getting busted in math class you you're doodling behind the behind the textbook
that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow
and an interesting thing happened a jacques cousteau shows up actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth
might not really go to an alien world are on the station sunday
and that that seem pretty and pretty darn unlikely
but i can tell is a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic is anything that i had imagined from reading these books
so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean
but it inlet that got me
i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class and in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live
then actually got certified are in a pool at a y m a in the dead of winter in buffalo new york
and i didn't see the ocean a real ocean for another two years until we so we moved to california
now since then you and in the in the intervening forty years of i've i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred of hours of that was in submersibles
and i've learned that that that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans is so are rich with with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination
are 's imagination is soul so boundless compared to our own art meager human imagination
i still to this day in absolute of what i did what i see when i make these times
and my love affair with the ocean 's design going in and just as strong as it ever was
but term one eyed when they chose a career as an adult of it was still making
and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this courage i had to tell stories with or my urges to work create images
and i was as a kid costly dr comic books and so on
so filmmaking was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense
and of course the stories that i chose to tell where science fiction stories terminator aliens many of us
and with the of this i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking
so you know merging the two passions
something interesting came out of the abyss which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature and we actually embraced are computer generated animation or cg
and this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie
and in the film than making money are barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience a global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic
you know it's arthur clarke law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
they were seeing something magical
and so that that that got me very excited
i thought wow this is this is something in needs to be embraced into the cinematic art
so with with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther
working with with file and we created the liquid metal duty in that film of that success in the balance on whether that fact would work
did we created magic again
we had the same result from was an audience
although we did make a little more money and that way now
so you know try line through those those two two dots of mix of experience came to this this is going to be whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for four film artists
so i started a company with stan winston to my good friend winston and who is a that the premier makeup and and creature designer at that time and it was called digital domain
and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the kind of analog process seasons of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production
we actually did that they gave us a competitive advantage for a while
but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we actually founded the company to do
so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic our human emotive are characters generated in c g. and the main characters all a g and the world would be in cg and they're tell the envelope push back
and i was told by a the the folks at my company that we were and be able to do this for a while
so i shelved it and i made this other movie about big ship that six
you know i when it does it to the studios romeo and juliet on ship
it's going to be this epic romance passionate film
secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real rack of titanic
and that's why they public
that's the through no studio didn't know that
but i convinced them i said i said we're going to die to the record and film it for real
we'll be using it in the opening of the film
but the really important in great marketing hope
and i talked them into funding an expedition
sounds crazy but this goes back to the theme about you know your imagination creating a reality
there's actually created a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submersible two and half miles down the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through prove viewpoint not a movie not hd the for real
now that that blew my mind
and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things
but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission
know where was it was highly technical and the required enormous planning
you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile our environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can get back by yourself
and you know i thought wow i'm like living in a science fiction movie
this is really cool
and so i i really got bitten by the blood of deep ocean exploration
course the curiosity science component of it
it was everything that was adventure it was curiosity was imagination
it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me
because you know i can imagine creature we create a visual effect for but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions i was seeing creatures that hydrothermal vents and and sometimes the things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them an image them
so i was completely smitten by this and had to do more
and so i actually made a of curious decision
after the success of titanic i said ok dollar park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and will be a full time explore for a while
and so you know we started planning these these expeditions
and the wind up going to the bismarck and and exploring with the with a robotic vehicles
we went back to the titanic wreck
we took little box that we had created this school the fiber optic
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship arm which had never been done
nobody ever looked inside wreckage and have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
so you know here i am now on the back of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out planks of wood much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
and i'm flying a little robotic vehicle through that through the corridor of the of the ship
you know what i say i know i'm i'm i'm operating to my mind is in the vehicle
i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic
it was a the most surreal a deja vu experience i've ever had because i would know before i turned the corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed that because i had walked the set for months we were making the movie
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship
so there was this absolutely remarkable experience
it really made me realize that your tell the tela presence experience and you actually can have these robotic avatars than your consciousness is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence
was really really quite profound
and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening have some decades out as a as we start to have a i cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means and in many sort of our post human future that that that i can imagine as a science fiction fans
so having done these these are expeditions a and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as that there at that the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing amazing animals
their data basically aliens right here on earth
they live in our an environment of chemo chemosynthesis
they don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do
and so you're seeing animals are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that
the you think they can't possibly exist
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know the science fiction influence as a kid
and i up getting involved with of the space community really involved without with nasa city on the nasa advisory board planning our actual space missions going to russia going through the pre not bio medical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems
and this was fascinating
but what what i wanna do is bring space scientist with us into the deep
and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientist people who are interested in these extreme of file environment taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on
so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space size
i completely close the loop between being a science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real
and you all along the way that in this journey of discovery i learned a lot
i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about leadership
they staked directors got the a leader to leader of the o captain the ship on thursday
i really learned about leadership until i did these expeditions
because i had up at a certain point say what am i doing out here
why am i doing this what i get out of it
we don't make money at these damn shows
you know we barely break even there's no shame in that
people of think i went away between titanic and avatar was buffing my male someplace you know sitting at the beach
made all these films made only the documentary films that you know for a very limited audience
no shame no glory no money what you doing
you doing it for the task itself for the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment areas for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team
because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
sometimes at sea for for four two three months at a time
and in that bond you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them that they have for you that have done a task that you can explain to someone else
when you come back to the shore you say we we'll we had to do this in the fiber optic and the attenuation of this and that although all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea you can explain to people it's that thing that that may be cops ever people and in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain
creates a bond creates a lot of respect
so when i came back to make by next movie which was avatar i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return
and it's really changed the dynamic
so here i was again with a small team and you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before
tremendously exciting
tremendously challenging
and we became a family over four and a half year period
completely changed how why do movies
so people of comment on how you know if you brought back the ocean are organisms and put them on the planet pandora
to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself the change as a result of that
so what can we synthesize out of all this
you know what's that one of the lessons learned
well i think number one is curiosity
it's the most powerful thing you own
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world
i have young filmmakers come up to me and say to him give me some advice for doing this
and i said don't put limitations on yourself
other people do that for you don't do it yourself don't bet against yourself
and and take risks
our nasa has this has this phrase is that they like failure is not an option
but failure has to be an option in art and exploration because it's a leap of faith
and no important endeavor the required innovation was done without risk
you have to be willing to take those risks
so that's a thought i would leave you with this and whatever you're doing failure is an option but fear is not thank you
if i can leave you with one big idea today it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overload what i'd like you to think about is how we can use that information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible
so what we're looking at rate here's a typical mortality chart organized by age
this cooled amusing here's a little experiment
it's called cave and with pettitte what i can do is i can choose to filter one particular cause of death say accidents
and right away i see there's a different pattern emerges
this is because in the mid hearing here people are the most active and over here for the most frail
we can step back out again and then re organize the data by cause of death seeing that circulatory diseases and cancers of the usual suspects but not for everyone
if we go ahead and we filter by h say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest called the people have to be worried about
and the drill to that it's especially the case for mac
so you get the idea that viewing information viewing data in this way is a lot like swimming and in living information and photographs
and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced
it's all here is on the web
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk
with today you can drill into a decade
you can drill into a particular year
you could operate into to a specific issue
some looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared on this issue the sports
and lance armstrong fan so go ahead and a click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lance armstrong's but apart
now if i want to just kind of take a peek at the sunlight take will what about taking a look at all cycling
so i can step back and expand on that
we great them on now
and you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrow broader backing in backing out you're not searching you're not browsing
we're doing something that's actually a little bit different
it's in between and we think it changes the way information can be used
so i to extrapolate on this idea that was something of a little bit crazy
what we've done here is we've taken every single wikipedia page every reduced it down to a little summary
so the summary consists of just little synopsis and icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from
i'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wikipedia pages for easier
but even this limited view we can do a lot of fedex
right away we get a sense of what are the top of all domains that are most popular wikipedia
i'm going to go ahead and slight government
now having selected government i can now see that the wikipedia categories that was frequently correspond to that our time magazine people of the year
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page
is only possible to see that and say you step back and look at all of them
looking at one of these particular summaries can and then drill into the concept of time magazine person of the year bringing up all that
so looking at these people i can see that the majority come from government
some have come from natural sciences
some fewer still have come from business
there's my boss
and the one person for music
and interestingly enough bano was also ted prize winner
so we can go jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners
so see were navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web not from page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch a little bit by surprise
i'm showing the new york times website here
so pivot this application i don't want to call our browsers not a browser here but you can view web pages with that and we green that zoo mobile technology to every single web page like this
so i can step back right back into specific section
now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way i can look at in my entire browsing history the exact same way
so i can drill into what i've done over specific time frames
here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave
and i could sort of replace and stuff that i was looking at earlier today
and if i won a step back and look at everything i can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history
here is doing some nepotistic searching looking for being over here for live lapsed event
and from these i could go to the web page the just launched them again
it one madoff for re purpose multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data
so right now in this world we think about date as being courage
we talk about the curse of information overload
we talk about drowning in data
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next week it used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise head
if we can do that then instead of being trapped in data we might actually extract information
instead of feeling just with information we can 's not knowledge
and if we get the knowledge that there may be given there's wisdom to be found
so with that i think you
can right here we have a machine a big machine called terrace machine and it's a time machine
and everyone in this room has to get into it
and you can go backwards you can go forwards you can not stay where you are
and i wonder what you choose because i've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back
i don't a want to go back before there were automobiles with twitter or american idol
i don't know
i am unconvinced that there's some sort of polten a scholarship to wishful thinking
i understand that
i'm not part of that crowd i have to say
i don't want to go back and it's not because i'm adventurous it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back to go forward
so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward
this is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health and wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease
there's never been a time like this
my great grandparents died all of them but the time they were sixty
my grandparents push that number to seventy
my parents are closing in on me
so i d better be it the better the a nine in the beginning of my death number
on that is even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest in the world a hundred years ago
think about that it's an incredible fact
why is it true
smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet
they reshape the demography of the globe in a way that no one ever has
it's gone it's advantage
we vanquished both
in the rich world diseases that threaten millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hard
diphtheria rubella polio
anyone even know what those things are
vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed it billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method
to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out see if it works changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity
so that's the good news
unfortunately not all the good because there are some other problems in the been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all the accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day
that number is rising as rising really rapidly and it's disgraceful
not only that have used our imagination to thoroughly trashed this world
potable water arable land reinforce oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon unless we innovate our way out of this mass we're going away too
so the question is can we do that and i i think we can
i think it's clear that we can make food that will see billions of people without raping the land that they live on
and we can power this world with energy that doesn't it also destroyed
i really do believe that they now in wishful thinking
but here's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night
we never needed progress in science more than meter that right now never and we've also never been in a position to deploy properly in the way that we can today
we're on the verge of amazing amazing advanced in many fields
and yet i actually think we have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we thought about these things more vigorously and on more fronts than we do now
people wrapped themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free
not even the truth will set them free
and listen everyone's entitled to their opinion there even entitled to their opinion about progress you know you're not entitled to
not entitled to your own facts sorry you're not
and this took me a while to figure out
about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines from the new yorker a little story
and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history
i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story in a move on
and on soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food
same thing only bigger
people were going crazy
so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods foods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than haphazard way was trespassing on 's grand
i then i do what i do i wrote a story and moved on
a journalist we try we file we go to dinner spot
but stories bothered me i couldn't figure out why and eventually i did
and that's because of those fanatics that were driving me crazy were actually fanatics at all
they were awful people educated people decent people
they were exactly like the people in this room
and it just to stir me so much
but then i thought you know let's be honest we're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to
we talk about it in ambivalently
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around progress
ok there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are
we've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself in there that there there's no reason we should not
you can just say a few names and people warner spent
chernobyl all the challenger vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads
will you know you can choose your list
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right
so be skeptical
ask questions to me and prove demand evidence
don't take anything for granted
but here's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we're not that good at doing that
and the reason that i can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fuel like one that i've never seen and hope never to see again
about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shot
very scary
times of studies were done to see if this was true
tons of studies should have been done it's in serious issue
the data they came back
the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all
doesn't matter it doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
we don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i do understand that i think we all do
you know what
the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here's a thought the united states is one of the only countries in the world with a vaccine rate for it is going down
that is disgraceful we should be ashamed of ourselves
it's horrible
what kind of what kind of a thing happen that we could do that
now i understand that i do understand
because anyone would have measles here
one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles
doesn't happen very much
doesn't happen in this country law but it happened a hundred sixty thousand times in the world last year
that's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour
but since it didn't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and literacy from platforms like oprah and larry king live
and they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation
they don't understand that these things seem the same but they're almost never the same
and it's something we need to learn and we need to learn it release
this guy was a hero jonas song
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us
no fear no adeney polio have gone
that guy in the middle not so much
his name is paul offit it
he just developed a rota virus vaccine with a bunch of other people
will save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year
pretty good right
what's good except the problems those around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are the people are just stop going
he actually says it that way
so because of terrorist
when paul it's in a public hearing he can't testify without armed guards
he gets called home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school
and why because palm made a vaccine
i don't need to say this but vaccines are essential
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases down that's happening we have measles in this country now
and it's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die down because it's just a numbers game
and not just going to die of measles
about that have that why not
a college classmate of mine wrote a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident
ones are set up before
she wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio
no way
finally
why because we don't have polio and you know what
we didn't have polio in this country yesterday
today i don't know maybe i got on a plane in us this morning he flying to allay acts right now is over ohio
it is going land in a couple hours can rent a car is going to come to long beach and he can attend one of these fabulous tie dinners tonight
and she doesn't know 's infected with the paralytic disease and we know either because that's the way the world works
that's the thing that we live on don't pretend it is
there we love to wrap ourselves in life we love to do it
everyone take their violence this morning
a usually like michelin work any the accident to get a going
and no did because half of americans do every day
they take the after they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we we find out that they're useless
the data says it all the time
the dark senior year and they almost never do more than that
you might been twenty billion dollars a year and i'm totally with you
right keelan dark
do we do that when we do that
i i understand we think big pharma
we think that government we don't trust the man
and we should have our health care system socks
it's cruel to millions of people
it's absolutely astonishing cold and sold them to those of us who can afford it
so we won away from and and where do we run
we leaped into the arms big placebo
that's fantastic i love it with you
you know it's not that it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap we spend billions of dollars on it
and and i have all sorts of little props here
not a good goat strong at in michelin fraud i i don't even know what that is what we're spending billions of dollars on its fraud
and you know i when i say this stuff people scream at me and said what can let people do what they want to do
it's it's it makes them feel good
and you know what you want
because i don't care if it's the secretary of hhs
hussein flute and take the evidence of my experts on mammograms or some cancer kwak who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas
when you start down the road where belief in magic replaces evidence in science you end up in a place you don't want to be
you end up in kabul mbeki south africa
he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting that the garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the anti retroviral drugs we know can slow the course of it
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease
please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things
there are there always are
now the most minus epidemic were in the middle of right now is stuff absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic wheat
it's an idiotic debate that has to stop
it's a debate about words about metaphors
it ideology is not science
every single thing we eat every grain of rice every spring of parsley every brussels sprout has been modified by man
in other words tensions in the garden of eden
there wasn't any kamilah
was christmas tree we made it all
we made over the last eleven thousand years
and some other worked in some of the did
we got rid of the stuff that didn't
now we can do it in a more precise way
and arrests absolutely
but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives
you want to do that
i have to say i don't understand it
we object to genetically engineered food
why do we do that
but the things i constantly here are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don't like giant fields of the same thing it's wrong
we don't want companies patenting life
know what companies owning seed
you know my response to all of that is
yes you're right let's fix it
it's true we've got a huge food problem that this isn't science
this has nothing to do with light
it slides morality it's nice stuff
you our science is in the company
it's not a country
it's not even an idea it's a process
it's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadly in its preventing millions of people from prospering
you know in the next fifty years we're going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now seventy percent
this is an investment in africa over the last thirty years
disgraceful disgraceful
they need and we're not giving it to them
and why genetically engineered food
we don't want to encourage people to eat that runs stuff like novel for instance
kasab i was something that half a billion people lead
it's kind like the potato
it's just a bunch of calories it socks
it doesn't have nutrients dozen of approaching and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now
and then people would be able to in then they'd be able to not go blind
they wouldn't start and you know what
probably nice wouldn't be shaken 's but it would be nice
and i can say about those is why are we will
i can let ask ourselves why we funny
because we don't want to move genes around
this is about winning are and it's not about chemicals
it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food
this isn't about race krispies is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant
because you know something
if we doubt if we continue to the way we're often were guilty of something that i don't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism
there's no other way to describe what's going on here
it's selfish it's ugly it's beneath us and we really have to stop it
so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say you sort of this ridiculous time machine and go forward
absolutely absolutely i do
that struck in present right now but we have an amazing opportunity
we can sack that time machine and any thing we want
we can move to where we want to move a we didn't that that where we want move
we have to have these conversations and we have to think but we get in a time machine and we go ahead we're going to be happy we do
i know that we can and as far as i'm concerned that something the world needs right now

one day los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music
and the source was a man an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violin that only had two strings
and telling the story that many of you know because steve's columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie with robert downey jr acting steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers the juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia
daniel dropped out of juilliard he suffered a complete breakdown and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles
i encourage all of you to read steves book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that form between these two men but how music helped shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if you'll pardon the pun in helping the get of the streets
i met mister ears in two thousand eight two years ago at walt disney concert hall
he had just heard a performance of beethoven's first and fourth symphonies and came backstage and introduced himself
was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo your mind hillary clinton how the dodgers were never going to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last minute 's fourth symphony
and we are talking about music and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me
now i should mention that mishandle refuses treatment because when he was she cheated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
but as a result now he is prone to these gets offended episodes
the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson that walt disney concert hall he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes he was lost
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep
and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraid that i was going to lose and that he was going to sink into one of his states and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy
so i just started playing
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto
and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in the tangle signs
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical a chemical reaction for which my playing the music was its catalyst
and if 's manic rage was transformed into understanding acquired curiosity and grace
and in a miracle he lifted his own violin and he started playing by year certain it's a violin concertos which he then asked to complete mendelssohn tchaikovsky venues
and was started talking about music from bach to beethoven and brahms bruckner and all the bees from bartok of all the way up to esa pekka salonen
and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music but he related to this music at a personal level
he spoke about it with kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic
and through play music and talking about music this man had transformed from a paranoid disturbs man that just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming air udeid really and juilliard trained musician
music is medicine music changes us
i for nathaniel music is sanity
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination his creativity into reality
and that is an escape from instrumented sticky
and i understood that this was the very essence of art
this is the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions and through our artistic learns to our creativity were able to shape those emotions into reality
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves this inspires and unites us
and for nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
and i will always make music with of weather at walt disney concert hall on skid row because he reminds me why i became a musician
thank you
and

and i shamelessly stole journalists
so recently
several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge
and the idea is pretty simple
teams of four have to build the tallest freestanding structure of twenty six of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of strain and a marshmallow
marshall has to be on top
and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporated into a design workshop
and it was a huge success
and since then i've conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the seat heroes of the fortune fifty and do something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i'd like to share some of them with you
so normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task
they talk about it they figure out what is going to look like they jockey for power than they spend some time planning organizing
the sketching the layout spaghetti and they'd spend the the majority of their time assembling the mystics into ever growing structures and then finally just as they're running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back and not
they admire their work
but what really happens most of the time is that the about turns into an old because the weight of the marshmallow caused the entire structure to buckle and collapse
so there are a number of people who have a lot more low moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
they live in that she'd say i get distracted they've them they produce really lame structures
and of course there's teams that have a lot more about structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten
and this remains
as peter tells us that not only they they produce the tallest structures but the most interesting structures of them all
so the question you would ask is how come why what is it about them
peter likes to say that none of us than the kids spend any time trying to be c ceo spaghetti in right
they don't time spent time jockey for power
but there's another reason as well
and the reason is that business students are trained to find a single right plant right
and then they execute on
and what happens is when they put the marshmallow on top they run out of time and what happens
it's a crisis
sound familiar right
but kindergartners do differently is that they start with a marshmallow and they build prototypes success of prototypes always keeping the marshmallow and tops so they multiple times and to to fix it the bill prototypes along the way
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process
and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work
so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but let's look at how different teams perform
so the average for most people is around twenty inches business school students about half of that lawyers will better but not much better than that kindergartens is better than most adults
it is the very best
architects and engineers thankfully
thirty nine inches the tall structure and i've seen
why is it because they understand triangles and self reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self about reinforcing this is stable structures
so i ceos little bit better than average
but was were gets interesting
if you put an an executive admen on the team they get significantly better
credible you know you look around you out that 's going to win
you just tell beforehand and why is that
because their special skills of facilitation
they manage the process they understand the process
and any team who manages and is a close attention to to work are will significantly improve the team's performance
specialized skills and facilitation skills of the combination leads to to strong success
have ten teams that typically perform you'll get maybe six or so are standing structures
and i tried something interesting
i 's up the ante once
so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team
so what do you think happened to these design students
it was the result
here's what happened
not one team had a standing structure
not one had a that if anyone had built say of a one instruction that d be taken on that the prize
so isn't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact
we did the exercise again with the same students
what you think happened there
so now they understand the value of prototyping
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best
they produce the tallest structures in the least amount of time
so there's a deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow the challenge
and the reason is i help create digital tools and processes to help their teams build cars and video games and visual effects
am and what the marshmallow challenge does it helps them identify the hidden assumptions
because frankly every project has its own marshmallow it
that the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype
and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise
and those of you who are interested may want to go to a challenge dotcom
it's a blog that you can look at how to build and the marshmallows
there step by step instructions on this
and there are crazy examples from around the world of have people we can adjust the system
this world records that are on this as well
and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task that we apply the very best of our thinking are feeling and are doing to the challenge that we have at hand
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from them a moment to a down moment
and that can make a big difference
thank you very much
